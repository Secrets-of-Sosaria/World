503072	The dragon won't be a problem after I make you an enchanted sword, but I need an ordinary longsword to do so.
503073	With the sword I gave you, you should be able to kill the dragon, perhaps in a single blow!
503074	Ahh, a young dragonslayer are you?  Well you will need help.  Bring me a smith's hammer, and I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the beast with!
503075	You should be able to get a smith's hammer from the blacksmith in town for a modest price.
503076	You should be able to get a longsword from the blacksmith in town for a modest price.
503077	Well, if you got bored, you could always go slay that cursed dragon!

503079	You should be able to get a longsword from the blacksmith in town for a modest price.
503080	The sword I gave you is all the help I can render you.
503081	What was it you needed help with?
503082	Given a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword, I can make an enchanted sword!
503083	I'll need a regular longsword to make an enchanted sword of.
503084	That sword does potent damage, but has very limited use.
503085	I can make an enchanted sword, but I'll need a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword to do so.
503086	I have already made you a glass sword, that is all I can do for you.
503087	Oops, I dropped it.
503088	Yes, with this I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the dragon with!  All I need now is your longsword... you do have one don't you?
503089	Good, now I will make your glass sword.  Remember you can only use it once, and I cannot make another!
503090	The sage chants for a moment, and hits your longsword with the hammer shattering the steel and revealing a blade of glass!
503091	I have already made you a glass sword, that is all I can do for you.
503092	Oops, I dropped it.

We'll learn how to use that shortly. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000018	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>At the bottom, the <B>Status</B> button will give you information about your Avatar's attributes and statistics. Before we cover those, let's learn about the <B>Backpack</B>. Your backpack is in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. It is where all of your items are stored when you are not wearing or using them. It can be opened by using it. Open it now by double left clicking the cursor on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000019	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! This is your backpack. It is where you can put the items that you find and need during your adventures through Britannia. Right now, there is a banana inside your backpack. We're going to use it to learn a few more ways you can interact with items. To <B>Look</B> at an item in the world, single left click on it with the cursor. A description will appear above the item when you do this. Look at the banana by moving the cursor over the banana and clicking the left mouse button once. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000020	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the description appears above the object? You can look at any object in the world with a single left click. Let's learn how to pick up things. Picking up an object is done by single, left clicking on it, just as you did to look at it, and then holding the mouse button down. You can then drag the item around. The item will stick to the end of the mouse cursor while you are holding it. Pick up the banana by moving the mouse cursor over it, and left clicking and holding the left mouse button down. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000021	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have now picked up the banana. Move the mouse cursor around. See how the banana moves accordingly and follows it? This is how you <B>Move</B> objects around in Britannia. Move the mouse cursor back over the backpack and release the left button. This will drop the banana back inside your backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000022	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed your backpack! The banana has been returned to your backpack for you. Clicking on, holding and dragging is how things can be moved around in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world can be used. For example, double left clicking on the banana will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000023	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you know how to <B>Move</B> an object in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world. For example, moving the cursor over the banana and double-clicking the left mouse button will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000024	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>YUM! You ate the banana. There is now a blue Hat in your backpack. Clothing and other equipment can be worn and removed. This is done by picking up and dragging the equipment over to your paperdoll. First, pick up the hat. Again, you do this by moving the cursor over it, and clicking and holding down the left mouse button on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000025	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now holding the hat. Be careful! You don't want to release the mouse button, as that would drop it. Drag the hat over to your head in the paperdoll and release the button. Doing this will <B>Equip</B> the hat. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000026	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have dropped the hat! I have returned it to your backpack. Try to pick up the hat again. Do this by moving the cursor over it, and left clicking and holding down the button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000027	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have <B>Equipped</B> the hat. See how it appears on your avatar as well as your paperdoll? You can equip clothing, weapons and armor in the same way as the hat. Now, let's learn how to take it off. Move the mouse cursor over the hat on your paperdoll, and left click and hold down the mouse button to pick it up. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000028	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you are holding the hat again. Drag the hat over the backpack and release the left mouse button to drop it in. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000029	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed the backpack! The hat has been returned to your backpack. Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000030	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000031	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>First, look in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. Do you see the <B>Dash symbol (-)</B>? This is the <B>Minimize</B> button. It appears on almost all of the windows in Ultima Online. Single left clicking on it will shrink down the window for convenience. Left click on the paperdoll minimize button, or dash symbol. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000032	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the paperdoll has shrunk down to a button-looking window that says <B>Character</B>? This is the minimized version of the paperdoll window. It can be moved around by left clicking and dragging just like any other window. To restore the paperdoll, you just double left click on the Character window. Double left click on it now.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000033	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll learn how to <B>Close</B> a window. To close any window, simply single right click on it. Single right click on your paperdoll window. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000034	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To reopen your paperdoll, simply double left click on your avatar. Now you know how to move, minimize, restore, and close all of the windows available to you. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000035	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you'll have a chance to use a little of what you have just learned. Inside of this room is a Red <B>Moongate</B>. A Moongate is a magical portal, which will teleport you elsewhere. The moongate is inside the smaller room with 8 doors. Walk over to these doors, and <B>Use</B> them. (Hint: Double left click on the doors!). After you have opened the doors, walk into the moongate. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000036	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn more about your avatar. Move the mouse cursor over your avatar. Now single click the left mouse button, hold it down, and drag the cursor off of your character. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000037	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your <B>Status Bar</B>. It is a handy representation of your avatar's characteristics. There are 3 major characteristics shown here. The first, and most important is the topmost bar. This represents your avatar's <B>Health</B>. Health shows you how hurt your character is. Your Health decreases when you are wounded. As your Health drops lower, the blue bar will shrink. Let's see what this looks like. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000038	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your Health has been lowered to half. See how the bar is now half blue and half red? The blue portion of the bar shows you how close you are to your maximum in that characteristic. So if you have very little blue left, watch out! Your other characteristics will work the same way. Health regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue and restore your Health to full. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000039	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next characteristic, shown as the middle bar, is <B>Mana</B>. Mana shows you how much magical energy that your character has available. Casting a spell will decrease your available Mana. Mana regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000040	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last characteristic is the bottom bar. This bar measures your current <B>Stamina</B>. The stamina bar lets you know how tired you are. Running, fighting, and other physical activities will decrease your stamina. Be careful not to let your stamina reach 0, as you will become too tired to move! Stamina, just like Health and Mana, regenerates over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000041	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to take a closer look at your status. The Status Bar can be maximized to a more detailed Status window by double left clicking on the bar. Maximize the bar now. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000042	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>As you can see this window gives you much more detail about your character. It gives you the number value of your current and maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina, as well as several other statistics. The first statistic, <B>STR</B> is your <B>Strength</B>. This is a measure of how strong and durable your avatar is. The higher your strength is, the more Health you have, and the more you excel at physical activity. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000043	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next statistic is <B>DEX</B> which stands for your <B>Dexterity</B>. This represents how agile and quick you are. If your Dexterity is very high, you will be able to dodge attacks, and perform physical activities more quickly. Dexterity also affects the amount of Stamina you have. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000044	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last Statistic is <B>INT</B> which is for your <B>Intelligence</B>. This represents how smart you are. A character with a high Intelligence will excel at mental activities such as spell casting. Intelligence also determines the amount of Mana that you have available. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000045	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next, <B>SEX</B> shows whether your character is Male or Female. Below that is <B>AR</B> or Armor Rating. AR represents how well protected your character is. The higher the AR, the better protected from damage you are. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000046	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next are the number values of Health, Stamina and Mana. Below that is <B>Gold</B>. This tells you how much money you currently have. Below that is <B>Weight</B>. Weight is an indicator of how much you are carrying. The more weight you are carrying, the more stamina you will lose during normal physical activity. Excessive weight will prevent you from moving at all! Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000047	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now that you are more familiar with your character, close the Status window with a single right click. Now follow the Red footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000048	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue to follow the footprints into the next room. Inside you will see a number of avatars. These are NPC's, or Non-Player Characters. NPC's are avatars that are run by the game. In this case, these NPC's are <B>Shopkeepers</B>. Shopkeepers will buy and sell items from players. Walk over to one of the NPC's and stand right next to them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000049	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>NPC's have a paperdolls just like you do. You open an NPC's paperdoll, just as you would open your own.  Simply double left click on them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000050	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The NPC paperdoll shows information about the NPC just as yours does. The clothing and equipment worn are shown as well as the NPC's name and profession. The <B>Status</B> of an NPC can be opened from the paperdoll as well. Close the NPC Paperdoll with a single right click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000051	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to buy and sell from an NPC. NPC's respond to speech, just like players do, but they require gold for their wares. Some gold has been placed in your backpack. Like all of your other items, gold is stored in your backpack. Open your paperdoll with a double left click on your avatar. Then, open your backpack with a double left click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000052	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now close your Paperdoll. (HINT: Single right click on it.). Your backpack will remain open. Inside of your backpack you will see some <B>Gold</B>. Looking at the stack of gold will show you the amount you possess. You currently have 10 gold pieces. We are going to use this gold to buy something from this Shopkeeper. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000053	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To let a NPC shopkeeper know you wish to buy from them, you must type in <B>Vendor Buy</B>. Type this in now and press the Enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000054	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the <B>Buy</B> window. Here you can make your selection from the wares of a shop. In this case, this vendor sells loaves of bread. The top portion of the window shows the name of the item, the cost, and the amount available. The bottom portion will display what items you have selected as well as the total cost of your items. Let's purchase a loaf of bread. This is done by double-clicking the left mouse button on the <B>Bread</B> description in the top window. Press the Next button after you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000055	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The available loaves of bread has been dropped by one and a loaf of bread has been placed in the bottom portion of the window. You are able to increase and decrease the quantity of items by using the <B>+ (plus)</B> and <B>-(minus)</B> buttons on the bottom half of the window.  To complete the transaction, single left click on the large red checkmark at the bottom left of the window. Press the Next button after you have done this.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000056	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great! Now you have a loaf of bread in your backpack. But you are also a few gold poorer. You only have 4 gold now. You can sell items to NPC's as well. They won't pay as much for an item as it is worth though. It's just not profitable for them! Let's sell the loaf of bread back to the NPC. Type <B>Vendor Sell</B>, and press the enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000057	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The <B>Sell</B> window is arranged the same way as the Buy window. Instead of the shopkeeper's items at the top of the window, <B>your</B> items are listed. Double-click the left mouse button on the loaf of bread description. It will appear in the bottom portion of the window. Note the amount the NPC will pay for the bread is around half of what you originally paid for it. Now single left click on the large Checkmark to finish the sale. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000058	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You have sold the bread! The appropriate amount of gold has been placed in your backpack and was neatly collected back into your stack of gold. Now that you are familiar with buying and selling from NPC's, let's move on to some combat! Follow the blue footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000059	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue following the blue footprints.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000060	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>These creatures are <B>Mongbats</B>. Mongbats are but one type of monster that plagues the people of Britannia. Monsters are like NPC's, but they do not have a paperdoll. They do have a simple status bar much like your own. To open the monster's status bar, left click on the mongbat, hold and drag the mouse off of it. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000061	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the Monster's status bar. It only shows the monster's Health. Like your status bar, the blue bar will gradually shrink as the monster gets closer and closer to death. When the bar is totally red, the monster will die. Now open your own status bar. Left click and drag the mouse off of you. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000062	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to go into <B>Combat</B> mode. Combat mode will allow you to attack monsters and other players. Press <B>ALT-C</B> (the ALT key and the C key at the same time). See how your status bar changes to a red color, and your avatar changes his stance? This is <B>Combat</B> mode, and it means you are ready to fight. Pressing ALT-C again will take you out of combat mode. Practice going in and out of combat mode a few times. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000063	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You can fight with just your fists, but to do more damage, you should use a weapon. To use one you must first equip it. A cutlass has been placed in your backpack for you to use. Open your paperdoll (Double left click on your avatar), and open your backpack. (Double left click on the backpack). To equip it we need to pick it up. Left click, hold and drag the cutlass out of the backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000064	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great! You have picked up the cutlass. Drag it onto your paperdoll and release the left mouse button to equip it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000065	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed! The cutlass has been returned to your backpack. Left click and hold on it and drag it on to your paperdoll to equip it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000066	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your weapon is now equipped. Close your paperdoll and backpack with a single right click on each. Now you are ready to <B>Attack</B> a monster. Go into combat mode, if you are not already. (Use <B>ALT-C</B> until your character is in his aggressive stance.) Open the mongbat's status bar with a left click hold and drag (if you had closed it). Then, move right next to a monster and attack it. To attack a monster <B>Use</B> it while you are in Combat mode. Do this now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000067	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now <B>Attacking</B> the monster! You will notice the mongbat has changed color and has a mini-health bar under it. This lets you know what you are in combat with. You will continue to attack the mongbat until it dies. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000068	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>HURRAH! You killed the monster. Now, <B>Use</B> the monster's corpse. This will allow you to take any treasure that the monster has. Double left click on the corpse of the monster, now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000069	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the Monster's corpse. Inside will be any equipment or treasure that the monster was carrying and has for the taking. In this case, the mongbat had a Crystal Ball. Pick up the Crystal ball with a Left click and hold. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000070	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now drag the Crystal ball directly onto your avatar and release the left mouse button. This will allow you to pick up items from the world without opening your backpack. They will go directly into your backpack when dropped this way. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000071	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed dropping on yourself. The crystal ball has been returned to the monster's corpse window. Now click and drag the Crystal ball directly onto your avatar. This will allow you to pick up items from the world without opening your backpack. They will go directly into your backpack when dropped this way. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000072	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Congratulations! You now know how to kill monsters and take their treasure. To finish up, follow the Blue Footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000073	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue following the blue footprints into the next room. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000074	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This red Moongate will take you to Haven. Haven is a city where you will continue your learning. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000075	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Going through this red moongate will transport you to a unique town in Britannia.

1002031	If you have a bow equipped, you can attack a player, animal, NPC or monster as you normally would.  The bow / crossbow will fire so long as you have arrows / bolts in your backpack.  You can attack your target so long as you have direct line of sight to them.
1002032	An archer can use a bow, crossbow or heavy crossbow.
1002033	Two good skills which are complimentary to marksmanship are bowcrafting and lumberjacking.  Lumberjacking will allow you to get wood from trees, while bowcrafting will allow you to craft this wood into shafts and make arrows.
1002034	Arms Lore

1002037	Banking
1002038	Your bank box serves one function in the game.  It allows you to safely store items you collect over time.  Only you will have access to your bank box.  If you wish to gain access to your bank box, you will need to say "Bank" at the local bank.  The banker will open your bank box for you.  Much like any other container in the land, you will be able to drag object to and from the container.  When you wish to close the container, right-click on it.
1002039	Bankers will also deposit or withdraw money for you.  To find out your balance, you may simply say "balance."  If you wish to withdraw 1000 gold, say "withdraw 1000."  If you wish to deposit 1000 gold, say "deposit 1000."

1002043	Blacksmith
1002044	To use your Blacksmithing skill, you will need to be near an anvil and forge. When standing near these you may use your tools to repair items, melt items, or craft items. A menu will appear once you use a blacksmithing tool near the anvil and forge.
1002045	You will need a blacksmith's hammer, a sledge hammer, or tongs to use your blacksmithing skill.  These tools will allow you to repair armor and weapons.  If you wish to create new weapons or armor, you will need metal ingots.
1002046	A good complimentary skill to blacksmithing is mining.  Your ability to melt items down to ingots depends on your mining skill.  Also, a successful miner will provide all the raw materials a blacksmith needs to become successful.
1002047	Bowcrafting
1002048	Learning the bowcrafting skill will allow you to create bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts.  For the self-sufficient archer, a good bowcraft skill is a must.  Crossbows and heavy crossbows use bolts, whereas a normal bow uses arrows.
1002049	To create bows or crossbows, you will need a bladed instrument such as a dagger or sword and boards.  Use the dagger by double-clicking on it.  This will bring up a menu.  If your skill is high enough, you will be able to attempt to make a box [???], crossbow, or heavy crossbow.  You will also be allowed to make shafts into arrows or bolts.  If you have feathers, you can double-click on the shafts and then select the feathers with the targeting cursor.  A new menu will appear with a choice of making arrows or bolts.  Select one.

In a short while, you will receive a message telling you that your campground is secure.  When you see this message, it will be safe for you to use a bedroll.  Doing so will log you out instantly.
1002053	You will need kindling in order to make your camp. You can garner kindling by using any bladed item on a tree.  You will also need a bedroll, which you can purchase from a provisioner.
1002054	Carpentry
1002055	The carpenter is able to fashion useful items from wood such as furniture, musical instruments, and even additions to homes.   A carpenter uses tools such as saws, nails, and joining planes when creating items.
1002056	To use your carpentry skill, you will need a joining plane, saw, or nails.  You will be able to use these tools by double-clicking on them.  You will then be asked to select the wood from which you wish to build your items.  Select a pile of boards or logs.  Different objects you wish to create will require different amounts of wood.  Experiment to see how much you will need.  Once you have selected the wood you wish to use, the menu displaying the items you can create will appear.  Select the item you wish to create and you will attempt to make that item.
1002057	Cartography
1002058	The cartography skill has two primary uses.  It can be used to create one of several types of maps. Secondly, it is used to decode treasure maps that are sometimes found as loot on monsters.
1002059	To create a new map, first you must obtain a blank map. Then, use your cartography skill from the skill list, and click on the blank map. A window will appear giving you a choice of map types. Select the one that you would like to create. Your chances of success, and the range and quality of your map will be determined by your skill level. Your location will be the center of the map.
1002060	To decode a treasure map, simply double click it. If your cartography skill is high enough, you will successfully decode the map. After you have decoded the map, you must also be the person to dig up the treasure using the mining skill.
1002061	This skill is useful for traveling on a boat. You can plot your course on the map, then give the map to your tillerman. Simply say "Start" and he will begin to travel the course you have plotted.
1002062	This skill is also useful to make maps for adventurers, selling maps of popular areas (such as dungeons), and selling maps to seafarers.
1002063	Cooking
1002064	Cooking allows you to bake raw food into tastier cooked food. First you must locate or build a fire. Campfires or forges will do for most dishes, however, some may require an oven. Once you have found a source of heat, double-click the food item you wish to cook, then target the forge, campfire, or oven. The cooking skill also allows you to try to combine certain foods to make new dishes.
1002065	Searching
1002066	Searching is  useful skill in several regards. Proficiency in this skill will allow you to detect hidden players, find traps on trapped chests, and detect dungeon traps. The higher your level of proficiency with this skill, the larger your search radius will be, and the greater chance you have of detecting other sorts of traps.
1002067	To use Searching, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the area or object you wish to search. When you successfully detect a trap, you will "notice something funny" about the object or area, and it will be revealed to all.
1002068	As your skill in Searching items increases, you may even begin to see traps automatically. This is a very difficult skill to learn, and may start happening after you have passed a skill level of 80 in this skill. Your ability to detect traps in this manner is dependent on the trap level and difficulty, and should not be relied upon in all situations.
1002069	Another useful application for this skill involves the homeowner. If you are the homeowner, or friend to a house, and use the searching skill in your household, you will reveal any players that may be hidden there.
1002070	Psychology
1002071	Psychology allows you to learn certain things about the mental makeup of the beings you select.  If you need to know how intelligent a being is and get an idea of their potential magic using ability, you will need to learn psychology.  A high psychology skill also allows mages to successfully overcome the natural resistance of creatures to magic.  Therefore, a high psychology skill may make a huge difference to a mage.
1002072	In order to use psychology, you will need to click on the skill from within your skill menu.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select the person or monster on which you would like to use your psychology skill.  If you are successful, you will determine their relative intelligence, and perhaps their current mana level.  You will not be able to use the psychology skill on Shopkeepers or Vendors.
1002073	Fencing
1002074	Fencing is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A fencer is capable of using a kryss, spear, pitchfork, war fork, rapier or dagger in combat to great effect.
1002075	Fencing, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002076	Seafaring
1002077	Use of the seafaring skill will allow you to catch fish from large bodies of water. Double-click on a fishing pole, then click on a body of water. If successful, you will catch a fish. Success with this skill also depends on the availability of fish in that specific area. You can also catch other items, including treasure maps and SOS messages in bottles.
1002078	Forensics
1002079	Use of this skill will allow you to find information about a corpse, and the events surrounding its demise. Use this skill by clicking the jewel in your skill list. You will be given a targeting cursor, target the corpse and you will be given information about the circumstances surrounding the demise. The higher your skill level, the higher your chances of determining these events, and the accuracy of your description.
1002080	This skill is also useful for other reasons. By using this skill on a living person, you may be able to determine their membership in the Thieves guild. Your ability to determine this is based on their skill level as a thief.
1002081	You can also use your detective skills to determine who recently picked the locks on locked containers and determine members of the Thieves Guild. Simply use the Forensics skill, and target the item you wish to examine. You must be a skilled detective to begin this practice, as you will not be able to begin learning this skill until you have a skill level of 40.
1002082	Healing
1002083	Use of the healing skill will allow you to heal yourself or other players. To use the skill, simply double click a bandage, and target yourself or the person you wish to heal. If you are successful in your efforts, the recipient will regain health, and the bandage will be used up. To create bandages, simply use scissors on cloth.
1002084	If you are healing another player, you must be near them during your efforts, if you leave their vicinity, your efforts will be in vain. If you are disturbed during your work, your fingers can easily slip, and your efforts will have less or no effect.
1002085	A highly skilled healer may be able to cure poisons or even resurrect other players. To accomplish this, you must be skilled in both healing, and anatomy. To cure poison, you must have a minimum of 60 skill in each area, and above 80 skill in each area, you may be able to resurrect ghosts.
1002086	Herding
1002087	Use of this skill will allow you to herd animals. To use this skill you must have a shepherd's crook. Double click the crook, and you will be given a targeting cursor. Simply target the animal you wish to herd, and then click the location you wish the animal to move to. The higher your skill, the more likely you are to successfully herd the animal.
1002088	Hiding
1002089	The hiding skill allows you to become invisible to other players. To use this skill, simply click the gem next to it in the skill list. If successful, you will become invisible to other players and monsters. You will be revealed if you move, speak, cast a spell, loot a body, attack someone or something, and other possible ways. It can be very difficult or impossible to hide while you are being attacked, so make sure to run a good distance away from your enemy and exit combat mode before attempting to hide. While you are hidden, you are not totally impervious to detection or attack. You can be revealed by spellcasters, the Searching skill, and can be tracked using the tracking skill. You can also take damage from area effect spells, and purple potions. You must remain wary even while hidden.
1002090	Inscription
1002091	This skill is used primarily to transcribe spells onto blank scrolls. To inscribe a spell onto a scroll, you must know the spell, have enough mana, and have the appropriate reagents for that spell in your pack (reagents will be consumed in the attempt). To begin, select the inscription skill from your skill list, then select a blank scroll. A scrolling list will appear which displays all of the spells you are capable of casting. From this list, select the spell you wish to inscribe.
1002092	To copy a spell from a scroll onto a spellbook, drag the scroll onto the book. Inscription is not necessary to do this.
1002093	To cast a spell from a scroll you can simply double click the scroll, and the spell will be cast. There are intelligence and magery requirements for casting spells from scrolls, but they are substantially lower than the requirements to cast them using magery.
1002094	Mercantile
1002095	Mercantile, if used successfully, will allow you to gather information about the chosen item. To use the skill simply click on the button and then click on the item to be identified. You will be given a description that varies in detail and accuracy depending on your skill level. (Depending on the ability of the user, the evaluation may be off by up to 50%)
1002096	Once you have identified an item, you will retain knowledge about that item.  Others will not benefit from your discovery, however.  They will have to identify the item themselves.
1002097	Lockpicking
1002098	The lockpicking skill is exactly that, it is used to open locked items. In order to attempt to pick a lock, you must have a set of lockpicks in your pack. Lockpicks can be purchased from thief shopkeepers.  Double-click on your lockpicks, and then target the item to be picked. Some locks are harder to pick than others (and some, such as house doors, are impossible to pick). Your skill level will determine your success rate.  If you are successful the lock will be picked, and you can open the item.
1002099	This skill is especially useful in hunting treasure from treasure maps. The treasure chests that are found will be locked and often trapped. Use of this skill along with searching (to find any traps) will prove useful.
1002100	Lumberjacking
1002101	The use of the lumberjacking skill will allow you to gain raw materials in the form of logs. The logs can then be used for carpentry, bowyering, or tinkering. Simply equip a hatchet or an axe, double click the weapon and then click on a tree. If you are successful in recovering wood it will be placed in your pack.
1002102	Bludgeoning
1002103	Bludgeoning is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A bludgeoner is capable of using a War Axe, Club, Hammer Pick, Mace, Magic Wand, Maul, Smithy Hammer, War Hammer, War Mace, Black Staff, Gnarled Staff, Quarterstaff, and Shepherd's Crook in combat to great effect.
1002104	Due to the heavy bashing of a mace weapon, bludgeoners have the ability to damage the armor of their opponents and remove their stamina.
1002105	Bludgeoning, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002106	Magery
1002107	This skill will allow you to cast a variety of spells in the game. The magery skill is automatically checked when you attempt to cast a spell, and your skill level will determine your chances of success in the attempt. To cast a spell, your hands must be free of any items (except a spellbook), you must have a spellbook with the appropriate spell contained therein, and you must have the appropriate reagents in your pack. Simply open the spellbook, choose the spell that you wish to cast, and double click the spell name. You can also click once on the spell name to get a more complete description of the spell, along with a 'tile' that represents the spell. If you wish, you can 'drag' the tile to your play area, and cast the spell by double clicking on the tile. Depending on the spell that you cast, you will be given different options for the next step, but the success or failure of your casting depends on your magery level.
1002108	If your spellbook does not contain a spell you wish to use often, simply acquire a scroll for that spell, and drag it into your spellbook. This spell will be added to the spells available for your use from this book.
1002109	It is also possible to cast a spell from a scroll. The proper reagents and skill are necessary to prepare the scroll initially, so casting from a scroll requires no reagents, and can be done with a lower level of skill.
1002110	Mages benefit greatly from meditation and psychology skills.  Meditation improves the rate at which a mage regains lost mana and psychology allows a mage to overcome an opponent's resistance to the mage's magic.
1002111	Mining
1002112	Cultivating the mining skill enables you to harvest the seams of ore that lie in the mines and mountains. This ore can then be smelted into ingots (using the mining skill) and the ingots can then be used to craft various items, such as armor (using the blacksmithing skill).
1002113	To mine ore you must have either a shovel or a pickaxe in your possession. Double-click on the axe or shovel and then, when the targeting cursor appears, click on a mountainside or a cave wall. If successful, you will mine either a small, medium, or large pile of ore, dependent upon a number of factors. The known ore types, in order of their prevalence, are Iron (the most common), Dull Copper, Shadow Iron, Copper, Bronze, Golden, Agapite, Verite, and Valorite.
1002114	The rarity and chances of finding various ores varies directly with the skill level necessary to mine it. The more rare the ore, the higher the skill level necessary to mine it.
1002115	A miner who is also a tinker will often be able to be self-sufficient.  Tinkers are able to create shovels and pickaxes necessary for miners.
1002116	Musicianship
1002117	Use of the musicianship skill will allow you to play an instrument. The ability to play an instrument is necessary for some other skills such as discordance, provocation, and peacemaking. To use this skill, simply double click the instrument of your choice. A music sample will play if you succeed, but an ugly noise will occur if you fail. The higher your skill level, the greater your chances of playing a pretty tune.
1002118	Parrying
1002119	This skill is used to determine your proficiency at blocking attacks with a shield. If you are using a shield, this skill is checked automatically each time that you are attacked. If successful, your attacker may miss his attack, or do less damage than normal.
1002120	Peacemaking
1002121	Use of the peacemaking skill will allow you to stop all fights in your immediate area. This skill is related to your musicianship skill, and will automatically check this skill when you use peacemaking. To use the skill, you must click the jewel in your skills list, and then click on your instrument (or the game will remember the last instrument that you played). If you are successful, all fights in the immediate area will stop, at least for a moment. The higher your musicianship and peacemaking skills, the more likely you are to be successful.
1002122	Poisoning
1002123	The poisoning skill can be used to poison a weapon or even food and drink. This will cause damage to whoever is attacked with the poisoned weapon, or to whoever consumes the food or drink. To poison a weapon simply use the skill from your skill list, and then select the vial of poison you wish to use, and finally click on the item you wish to poison. If you poison a weapon, you will lose karma.  This item will now be poisoned until you use it. Once the poisoned weapon is used you will have to repeat the process to poison it again. The same process is used to poison food or drink. Select the skill and then click on the vial of poison. Then click on the consumable, and presto! The food or drink is now poisoned for a period of time. To create the vial of poison you will need to have the reagent nightshade, and then mix it in pestle and mortar. Once it is mixed, it will pour into the empty bottle in your pack. You can then use this green potion to poison items.
1002124	When you wish to poison an item, DO NOT double click the green potion first. If you do this, you will drink the poison. This does not give you the results you had hoped for, as you will have just poisoned yourself.
1002125	Provocation
1002126	This skill is used to encourage other creatures to fight one other. You will need a musical instrument to accomplish this task. To use the skill, first select the provocation skill from the skills list, target the instrument you wish to use (or the game will remember the one you last used), and then click in turn on each of the creatures you wish to fight one another. If you are successful the two creatures will fight for a time consistent with their respective natures and dispositions. Please keep in mind that you cannot provoke other characters.
1002127	Reagents
1002128	Black Pearls are rare, and are often referred to as the reagent of movement. When finely ground into a powder, black pearls can invoke spells that teleport of propel the caster to another location.
1002129	Blood Moss takes its name from its reddish color. Prevalent in wetter surroundings (such as marshes or swamps), this type of fungi is a base reagent for spells involving locomotion or animation.
1002130	The ground paste of a ripe bulb of garlic has a reputation for warding off evil. This effect accurately describes its use as a reagent as well. Modern magicians use garlic in spells that protect the caster (or a specified target) or dispel danger.
1002131	Ginseng is hailed as the reagent of health, as its syrup bestows both healing and restoration. Common Britannia folk use it as a home remedy for fatigue and sickness, but true magicians appreciate ginseng for its magical qualities and always keep a healthy portion on hand.
1002132	Mandrake Root is harder to find than other reagents, although it is probably the most commonly used of the eight base reagents. Like blood moss, it thrives in dark, dank, areas, where most dare not venture. Those that do search out this precious root are rewarded by being able to cast spells invoking strength and energy.
1002133	The nightshade plant is as deadly as its long-standing reputation. Its touch can poison a human
1002134	Spider's silk is an inexpensive reagent, as it is quite plentiful and light on one's back, even in large quantities. However, it is so fine that massive amounts of fibers are consumed by a single spell. True to its origin as webbing, this reagent calls forth summoning and binding spells.
1002135	Foul smelling but powerful, sulphurous ash is a dusty volcanic residue. It is found mainly in Britannia's mountainous regions and is a common element of any spell releasing fire, light, or explosive energy.
1002136	Remove Trap
1002137	The skilled rogue will be able to disarm traps using the Remove Trap skill. In order to begin learning the art of removing traps you must first demonstrate proficiency at Lockpicking, and Searching. You must have a base level of 50 skill in both of those skills before you can begin your training in this area. To use the Remove Trap skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the item that you wish to disarm. If you are successful in your attempt, you will disarm the trap. Failure to disarm the trap stands the possibility of setting off the trap. The higher your skill level, the more difficult the trap you can disarm. You must be very careful when using this skill, it can be quite a risky proposition. To disarm traps, you must be quite nimble, and will find that wearing gloves makes this process much more difficult.
1002138	Snooping
1002139	The Snooping skill is used to see into another player's backpack. To use the snooping skill, simply double click on another player's pack, and if you are successful, the pack will appear open to you on the screen. Be warned however that a large majority of players do not care for a player who frequents the use of this skill. This skill is best used in conjunction with stealing. To steal from other players, you must be a member of the thief's guild.
1002140	Spiritualism
1002141	Spiritualism is used to be able to understand the speech of ghosts. If you do not have this skill you will only be able to see a series of "oooooo"s emanating from the deceased. To use this skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and if you are successful you will be able to understand the ghost. Keep in mind that the length of time the interpretation lasts is directly related to the level of skill you have attained and your level of intelligence.
1002142	Stealing
1002143	The skilled Pickpocket may be able to steal items in several manners, from a variety of sources. You may be able to steal from monsters, chests, NPC's, or other players (if you are a member of the thieves guild, or if they are an opponent in a guild war). You can attempt to steal in two ways. First, use the skill from your skill list, and target the container, creature, NPC, or player. This is a 'random steal' and will attempt to steal an item at random from this source. The second method is to first 'snoop' the container using your snooping skill, and then select a specific object to steal. Dragging this item into your inventory will check your stealing skill to determine your chances of success. The skilled pickpocket must be very dexterous in his or her work, and will find that the more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal.
1002144	There are four possible outcomes to stealing:
1002145	-  True Success: you get the item and are not noticed
1002146	#NAME?
1002147	#NAME?
1002148	#NAME?
1002149	If your attempt is noticed, the guards can be called on you, so you must be very careful when attempting these practices. It is also important to note that for two minutes after stealing, the member of the Thieves' Guild is freely attackable by anyone in the area. In towns, the proscription against starting fights still applies, so even Thieves' Guild members will be safe from random attack, even if everyone knows of their affiliation.
1002150	As mentioned above, you will not be able to steal from other players unless you are a member of the thieves guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. You can join the thieves guild in the usual manner, by finding a Thief Guildmaster and asking him to join. There will be an entrance fee, and there are several entrance requirements. Your character must have adventured in the world for at least one week, must not have any murders to his name, and must have already demonstrated proficiency in stealing (60 skill minimum). The requirements to stay in the guild are stringent as well. If you are reported for murder, you will be summarily ejected from the guild, and cannot rejoin for one week. Also, once you join the guild, you cannot leave for one week, unless ejected from the guild. Thieves Guild members cannot report murders, and thus could be considered "freely" attackable anywhere in the world (except in justice regions, unless they steal from another player).
1002151	Swordsmanship
1002152	Swordsmanship is a melee combat skill, which allows for a strong-arm attack style of fighting.  A swordsperson is capable of using an axe, a battle axe, a double axe, an executioner's axe, a hatchet, a large battle axe, a pickaxe, a two-handed axe, a butcher knife, a cleaver, a skinning knife, a bardiche, a halberd, a broad sword, a cutlass, a katana, a longsword, a scimitar, or a barbarian sword in combat to slice there opponents to ribbons.
1002153	Only the one-handed weapons of a swordsman can be poisoned.  You must be careful when using a poison weapon, as the poison will damage the weapon and make it more likely to break.
1002154	Swordsmanship, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the appropriate weapon equipped, you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002155	Tailoring
1002156	Use of the tailoring skill will allow you to make a wide variety of items, ranging from bandages to clothing, and even leather armor. Your raw materials can come from a variety of sources, from hunting animals for leather, to gathering cotton and spinning thread. You can also purchase materials from a vendor and craft them into items for resale.
1002157	To get leather from a cow, you will need to kill it and skin it.  In order to skin the cow, use a bladed weapon on the carcass.  This will leave hides on the corpse.  You may also get hides from other animals.
1002158	You may purchase cloth, or you may also find cotton lying in fields.  If you do find cotton, you may use the cotton.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select a spinning wheel to use the cotton on and it will produce cloth.
1002159	Once you have your raw materials, you can make a wide variety of items. You need a sewing kit to tailor these items. A sewing kit can be purchased from a tailor.  Use the sewing kit with the materials in your pack. You will be given a window presenting the categories and items that you can craft with your skill level and materials. Choose the item you wish to make, and target the material if necessary. If you are successful, the item will be placed in your pack. If you do not have room in your pack, you will be unable to create the item. As your skill level rises, you will be able to make more complex items, and your chances for success will increase. After creating some items, you may wish to dye them to increase their appeal. You can do this by purchasing a dye tub, and some dyes. Just double click the dyes and select the tub you wish to use them on, then select the color you wish the tub to be. You can then dye items by double clicking the tub, and targeting the item you wish to dye.
1002160	Tasting
1002161	Use of Tasting will allow you to determine the sort of potion you have in your possession, or to determine if an object is poisoned or not. Simply use the skill from the jewel on your skill list, and then target the item you wish to taste. If successful, you will be told what kind of potion it is (if the object is a potion) or whether or not it's poisoned (if it's not a potion).
1002162	Tinkering
1002163	The tinkering skill is used to make tools for other professions, and also to make clocks, sextants, and to trap containers. With this skill you can make hammers, tongs, scissors, smoothing planes, and numerous other tools. To make these tools and assorted items you will need a set of tinker's tools. First double-click on the tinker's tools, and then select your supply of metal or wood. A window will open displaying the items that you can make from the raw materials available (either wood or metal). You will need ingots for metal and boards for wood.  Some additional items may be necessary, such as gems for rings.
1002164	To place a trap on a container you must have a chest or other container, a poison potion, explosive potion, or crossbow bolt, and a small supply of metal. Use your tinker tools, then target your metal, and choose the type of trap you wish to make. Last, target the container you wish to trap. If successful, the container will become trapped, and the trap you have created will affect the next person who illegally opens this item. Using the proper key on this container will bypass the trap and allow you to open the chest safely. The strength of your trap will be directly related to your skill as a tinker.
1002165	Tracking
1002166	The tracking skill will allow you to track animals, monsters, and people. Use the skill by clicking the jewel on your skill list. You will be presented with a window, which will allow you to choose what you wish to track. Double-click the category you wish to track (animal, human, or monster), and you will be presented with a second window listing the specific PCs or NPC's that you can track. If you are successful, and an appropriate creature can be tracked, you will be told in what direction that creature can be found. The higher your skill level in tracking, the more likely you are to successfully track an object, and the farther you will be able to track it.
1002167	Veterinary
1002168	The veterinary skill will allow you to heal animals in much the same way that the healing skill works on people. To use the skill, simply double-click on a bandage, you will receive a targeting cursor, and then target the animal you wish to heal. The amount of healing that you provide will be based on your skill level.
1002169	Fist Fighting
1002170	This skill is used while in hand-to-hand combat (no weapon equipped). It is checked automatically when you fight, and may determine the frequency, and damage level with which you will strike your opponent.
1002171	The fist fighting skill has several uses in combat and may even be used to stun opponents.  If you do not have a weapon equipped and you attack a creature, your fist fighting skill will come into play.

1007020	Tis no surprise that I'd say aye'.
1007021	Truth is tough. It will not break.
1007022	Keep from me the divinity of Yes and No.
1007023	Who then is going to say Nay?
1007024	T'is no good arguing with the inevitable.

1007063	Surely thou canst hit harder than that!
1007064	A bare touch... Thou dost not wield thy weapon well!
1007065	Ouch! A touch indeed!
1007066	'Twill take more than that to kill me!

1007167	Money is always welcome.

1008007	Now, I shall kill thee.
1008008	A warrant is outstanding for thy execution.
1008009	Thou hast made a fatal mistake by showing thy filthy face.
1008010	'Twill be a pleasure to dispatch a scoundrel such as thee.
1008011	Beware, all, whilst I dispose of this evildoer.
1008012	'Tis a shame that thou canst not reform, for now I shall have to kill thee.
1008013	Thy sort is not welcome here. Thou hadst best run now.
1008014	Get out of our city, scum!
1008015	Don't do anything foolish.
1008016	We'll be keeping an eye on thee.
1008017	I know thy type. Break not the laws, or else suffer punishment!
1008018	Thou hast a suspicious look about thee.
1008019	I trust thee not, nor should anyone. Thou art a ruffian.
1008020	Faugh, another scoundrel to keep an eye on!
1008021	I have heard of thee--keep thee to the straight and narrow whilest here!
1008022	If I catch thee breaking laws, thy neck will be on the line.
1008023	Thou hast an unsavory reputation--best that thou dost not prove that thou earnst it.

1008025	Mine eye is on thee, scoundrel. Break not the law.
1008026	Thou art a scofflaw, but while here thou SHALT obey the laws, or suffer.
1008027	Look thee who crawled out from under a rock! Well, thou shalt not do anything illegal whilst I am watching thee!
1008028	The guards well know thee and thy nefarious ways! be sure to behave thyself!
1008029	Scum! Stay not overlong here, for thou art not welcome!
1008030	I hope that thou art merely visiting, for we mislike knaves mingling with our citizens.
1008031	Thou shouldst leave this city before any decide to lynch thee.
1008032	I should arrest thee now, before thou dost something terrible. Thou art well known as a rogue of the worst kind.
1008033	Thy foes ye meet, no doubt ye should harm.
1008034	Thy traps ye find, ye shall defeat.
1008035	The treasures within, should become part of thee.
1008036	Thou hast thy bravery at least.
1008037	Your reputation doth proceed thee.
1008038	I know not of you, your fate is shrouded in mystery.
1008039	Foul beasts within, whom ye may find good company.

1008042	The clouds of time reveal the ghosts of the past, still priesting over their congregation.
1008043	Ye shant not fail, have you the eye of an eagle, the strength of an ox and the nimbleness of a wolverine.
1008044	The clouds have reveal a philosopher, a priest and three thousand leagues of skeletons marching row by row.
1008045	The halls of fate, the halls of doom, in wells of thought, one might find room.
1008046	Ghastly shadows on forlorn walls, echo the death of foes and falls.
1008047	Beware ye who pass this way, for darkness works in mysterious ways.
1008048	On bended knee they came and slew, ten thousand souls for the freedom of Yew.
1008049	Brave hearts dive in and yet not return, their fate swallowed by the fires that burn.
1008050	Once a treasure was laid at the bottom of the tomb, in darkness and light, its wealth did bloom.
1008051	Cast not one eye to the flames' disguise, for marching in order are invisible eyes.

1011020	Many people in town can improve your skills. To find out if I can improve skills you are interested in simply walk up to me and say 'TRAIN'. I will give you a list of the skills that I'm proficient in. To choose the skill you want to train in, say 'TRAIN' and the name of the skill you'd like to be trained in, and I will tell you the cost. Drag the gold from your backpack and drop it onto me, and your skill will be increased. If you don't have enough for the full payment, you can pay less but your training won't be as complete and you won't gain as much skill as you could if you paid the full amount. The amount of skill that can be raised is dependant on the ability of the teacher, so it is best to seek out Grand Masters when trying to learn the most about a particular skill. Remember that there is an overall limit to the amount of skills that you can learn, so you may not want to try to learn all of the skills in this manner.

1011038	Hello. I am a shopkeeper. If you would like to buy or sell any items, then simply find a shopkeeper and say to them 'VENDOR BUY' in order to see the list of items they sell, or 'VENDOR SELL' in order to see if they're interested in buying anything you own. If you do have any items in your pack that a vendor is interested in purchasing, saying 'VENDOR SELL' will cause him to look through your pack and show you a list of the items he's interested in, as well as what he'll pay for each item. If he's not interested in anything you possess, he will let you know that as well. To purchase an item, simply look through the list that appears when you say 'VENDOR BUY' and select any item you can afford. It will appear at the bottom of your list, along with a running total of your current purchases.

1011448	The followers of Minax have taken control in the old lands, and intend to hold it for as long as they can. Allying themselves with orcs, headless, gazers, trolls, and other beasts, they seek revenge against Lord British, for slights both real and imagined, though some of the followers wish only to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace.
1011449	The council of Mages have their roots in the city of Moonglow, where they once convened. They began as a small movement, dedicated to calling forth the Stranger, who saved the lands once before.  A series of war and murders and misbegotten trials by those loyal to Lord British has caused the group to take up the banner of war.
1011450	True Britannians are loyal to the throne of Lord British. They refuse to give up their homelands to the vile Minax, and detest the Shadowlords for their evil ways. In addition, the Council of Mages threatens the existence of their ruler, and as such they have armed themselves, and prepare for war with all.
1011451	The Shadow Lords are a faction that has sprung up within the ranks of Minax. Comprised mostly of undead and those who would seek to be necromancers, they pose a threat to both the sides of good and evil. Their plans have disrupted the hold Minax has over Felucca, and their ultimate goal is to destroy all life.
1011452	This city is not controlled by any faction.
1011453	This city is controlled by Minax.
1011454	This city is controlled by Lord British.
1011455	This city is controlled by the Council of Mages.
1011456	This city is controlled by the Shadow Lords.

1014000	A goodly carpenter lives not far from the market square before the castle gate.
1014001	A quite well-appointed provisioner's exists East of the river, just North of the Lighthouse.
1014002	Ah, 'tis a terrible thing, but the graveyard far to the south has become infested with the living bones of the dead.
1014003	An inn called Sweet Dreams lies next to the Main Gate, just East of the healer's shop.
1014004	Blackthorn stays out of sight mostly, sequestered in his castle up North of Britain.
1014005	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014006	Britain is bounded by two rivers. The Narrows is on the west and Brittany River on the east.
1014007	Despite its name, the Sweet Dreams inn is quite good. It is near the Main Gate.
1014008	He liveth here, in Britain, in his castle.
1014009	I know naught of thieves!
1014010	If there be one thing Britain is not lacking, it be inns!
1014011	If there's not a mapmaker to be found at the Oaken Oar, then I can't help thee much.
1014012	LB? Mayhap thou means Lord British ....
1014013	Long ago the Narrows were dug up to meet the moat, and now 'tis fed from the water of Brittany Bay.
1014014	Lord British supports the arts. There is a public theatre across from the Bardic Conservatory.
1014015	Narrows Neck is the name for the river mouth on the southwestern side of Britain.
1014016	That is the name of the old gate beside the castle moat, for once the poor came in through there to go to market. It is quite narrow.
1014017	That's the river that runs down the middle of the city.
1014018	The alchemist can be found with the mages in the the magic shop in front of the Main Gate.
1014019	The ankh in the temple is capable of restoring life to the dead. 'Tis in northern part of town, beside the river.
1014020	The blacksmith North of the Miner's Guild can probably sell thee anything thou might need.
1014021	The Blue Boar is just North of the library, on the river.
1014022	The butcher can be found between the docks, near the customs house.
1014023	The Cat's Lair is a bit disreputable, as it lies near the docks, but its beer is good.
1014024	The center of the musical arts in Britain is the Bardic Conservatory on the north side of town.
1014025	The city's sole veterinarian lives by the river, by the Mage's Bridge.
1014026	The Customs office checks imported goods. 'Tis on the waterfront.
1014027	The farms in this area are all in the countryside, to the west of Lord British's castle. Thou must cross the Narrows and follow the road there.
1014028	The First Bank of Britain lies next to the jeweler's, beside the moat.
1014029	The guildhall of the Mechanicians, or the Tinkers as some call them, is right beside Poor Gate.
1014030	The Mage Tower is the building with all the arches, made of grey stone, on the north side of the town.
1014031	The Main Gate divides the central city from the waterfront.
1014032	The Northside Inn is situated on the lake that surrounds Blackthorn's Castle.
1014033	The Oaken Oar houses excellent shipwrights. It is on the waterfront by the mouth of the Narrow Neck.
1014034	The ocean is to the south of Britain.
1014035	The Salty Dog is a tavern overlooking the park, right next to The Wayfarer's Inn.
1014036	The Warrior's Guild is housed in the Old Keep.
1014037	The waterfront is what many call everything south of the old city wall. Properly speaking, it runneth along the river from River's Gate Bridge, down along the water to the Oaken Oar and the Narrows.
1014038	The Wayfarer's Inn is beside the Mage's Gate, on the East side of the river.
1014039	The weapons trainer? Ah, that is on the north edge of town, on the eastern bank of the river. 'Tis called the Cavalry Guild.
1014040	There are many guilds in this city. 'Tis the benefit of living in Lord British's capital.
1014041	There are two gates in the old city walls. The Poor Gate, and the Main Gate are the names.
1014042	There are two guardhouses. One near the Gung-Farmer's Bridge, and the other next to Virtue's Pass.
1014043	There be a guildhall for the artisans of the town outside the old walls, south of the Armorer's.
1014044	There is a blacksmith beside the castle moat on the northern edge of town.
1014045	There is a healer on the market square, near the Main Gate.
1014046	There is a jeweler's just to the South of the Artist's guild.
1014047	There is a leatherworker's shop facing the market square.
1014048	There is a Mining Guild beside the city library.
1014049	There is a plague of orcs on the western side of the farms--if thou seekest their encampments, that is the place to look.
1014050	There is an armourer's shop beside the Mage Gate. Just South of the old city wall.
1014051	There's a baker on the market square before the castle gate.
1014052	Thou canst buy weapons at the blacksmith's shop.
1014053	Thou canst purchase clothes on the East side of the river, near the Cypress Bridge.
1014054	Thou canst see that the old city walls are of a different vintage stone than the castle proper. 'Twas built before the current castle buildings.
1014055	'Tis an expensive place, but the Unicorn Horn, overlooking the ocean on the east side, serves a decent ale.
1014056	'Tis being repaired, but it stands on the promontory o'erlooking Brittany Bay.
1014057	'Tis the bay on our southern coast.
1014058	Try the bowyer just East of the theatre.
1014059	Try the stables beside the Mage Tower.
1014060	Which sort of smith? Weaponsmith, blacksmith?
1014061	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014062	Incantations and Enchantments is in the middle of eastern Britain, on the south side of the park.
1014063	There are many bridges across the Brittany. There's the Great Northern Bridge at the north-most end, the Mage's Bridge, then the one we call Virtue's Pass. South of that there's Cypress Bridge, and the River's Gate Bridge. And, of course, the Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects Britain with the farmlands to the West.
1014064	The bridge next to the Mage's tower is thus called the Mage's Bridge.
1014065	The Cypress Bridge is surrounded on one side by a tailor's shop and on the other by a magic shop.
1014066	The Great Northern Bridge is so called because it's the Northern-most bridge in Britain.
1014067	The Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects all the farms with Britain proper.
1014068	The Southernmost bridge is called River's Gate.
1014069	There are three or four merchants of the arcane in Britain.
1014070	There's the Salty Dog, The Unicorn's Horn, The Cat's Lair, and The Blue Boar taverns, here in Britain.
1014071	Thou art in Britain.
1014072	Thou can find the Ethral Goods Magic Shop just south of the Main Gate. Next to the Premier Provisioner's shop.
1014073	Thou can get to the Sage Advice Magic Shop on the east side of the river.
1014074	Thou can purchase arcane goods at the Sorcerer's Delight - which some call the Mage Tower. It can be found in northern Britain, next to the Conservatory of Music.
1014075	Thou can work on thy swordplay at the old keep, south of Lord British's castle.
1014076	Ah, the weather... 'Tis an interesting thing, really. No matter what the season, no matter what enchantments are cast, our land is almost always blessed with clear and beautiful blue skies.
1014077	Bedrolls can be purchased from a provisioner.
1014078	Britanny Bay is the body of water on the edge of Britannia's capital.
1014079	Certainly, thou art welcome.
1014080	Cove? Thou shouldst find it North and East of Britain.
1014081	Dupre? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe. If thou wert to search for him, I wouldst most recommend a tavern.
1014082	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014083	Farewell.
1014084	Goodbye.
1014085	Greetings.
1014086	Hello.
1014087	Here.  In Town.
1014088	I accept.
1014089	I am well.
1014090	I cannot help thee.
1014091	I cannot speak but fondly on my homeland. Yet I would not forgo an opportunity to see other lands.
1014092	I can't take it. Sorry.
1014093	I don't want it. Sorry.
1014094	I have heard that the great dungeons sometimes have great treasures.
1014095	I know not of which thou doth speak.
1014096	I live here in _Town_.
1014097	I live in the town that thou art standing in.
1014098	I really don't need it.
1014099	I shall accept with pleasure.
1014100	I shall be happy to take it!  Thank thee!
1014101	I will take it, then.
1014102	I work here in town.
1014103	I work in the town that thou art in.
1014104	I would not live in Buccaneer's Den if I were thee, for it is home to the most vile men and women to sail the seas.
1014105	If thou art able to hunt the wild animals, sometimes thou can sell the meat that thou dost carve from them to a butcher.
1014106	If thou art wanting a respite from the rigors of Britannia, then thou can make a camp or check in to an Inn, whichever is the most convenient.
1014107	If thou can get an axe, perhaps thou could cut some trees into useful boards for woodworkers. They may be willing to pay thee for them.
1014108	If thou dost happen upon some ore, go to the blacksmith's shop and try to craft some armor or weapons. I have heard that it just takes practice.
1014109	If thou dost want to earn money, practice a skill. Make things and sell them to the public. Most shopkeepers will let thee use the tools and materials that they aren't using.
1014110	I'm doing relatively well.
1014111	Iolo? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014112	It's essential to have good kindling and a bedroll if thou dost want to camp.
1014113	I've been needing one of these.
1014114	I've heard that Lord Blackthorn has written a couple of books describing his philosophies in-depth. If thou dost find these, I imagine thou wouldst be able to say better than I what Blackthorn is about.
1014115	Just fine.
1014116	Let's see... I remember the names of Shame, Wrong, Despise, and Hythloth. I've never owned a map of Britannia myself.
1014117	Lord Blackthorn wishes the freedom of choice in ALL things extended to everyone. Some say that he'd even sees the Orcs and Lizardmen as equals to the humans in Britannia.
1014118	Lord Shamino? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014119	Not a problem.
1014120	Only the bravest knights belong to the Order of the Silver Serpent. 'Twas they who defeated the forces of Lord Robere.
1014121	Our moons are called Trammel and Felucca. They control the moongates.
1014122	Please back away a bit.
1014123	Please, keep it. I don't want it.
1014124	Right here.
1014125	Shrines to the virtues are spread around our land. I've heard that they can even resurrect the dead.
1014126	Tanners will buy hides and pelts that thou dost take from the animals thou dost hunt.
1014127	Thank thee!
1014128	Thank thee, but I don't want it.
1014129	Thank thee. Don't need any.
1014130	The moongates? They are... doors to different parts of Britannia. Except the destinations of the doors change with the phases of the two moons.
1014131	The name is familiar to me... ah, yes -- I believe he is the infrequent guest of Lord British. Mayhaps thou wilt find him sampling the local spirits.
1014132	There are many as yet unmapped places beneath Britannia. 'Tis rumored to be riches and magic in them. And creatures that will rend the flesh from thy bones.
1014133	This will come in handy indeed.
1014134	Thou art most kind!
1014135	Thou art most kind, but it isn't anything that I need.
1014136	Thou art nearer to me than I like.
1014137	Thou can find a good deal of treasure under Britannia. Look to the caves and what thou call dungeons.
1014138	Thou can sell feathers from birds to a bowyer. And a cook may purchase the bird itself from thee.
1014139	Thou shouldst be able to get kindling from any wood thou finds. If thou has an axe, of course.
1014140	Thou shouldst learn to use the moongates if thou dost plan to travel far. The key is in the phases of the moons.
1014141	Though a kind and generous man in his youth, Lord Robere thirsted for power in his later years, so legends say.  Had not the Order of the Silver Serpent been ready to fight for Lord British, this very land could have belonged to the ambitious conqueror.
1014142	Thou'rt welcome.
1014143	Tis the bay that touches the city of Britain.
1014144	Tis very generous of thee, but I don't need it.
1014145	Tis very generous of thee.
1014146	Various issues surface from time to time, such as taxation, invasion, protection form creatures of the wild.
1014147	Vesper? 'Tis a city in northeastern Britannia. Ore from the mines of Minoc are sent down river to be unloaded in Vesper.
1014148	Well, well, what have we here?
1014149	Why standest thou so near to me?
1014150	Wilt thou stand back a bit
1014151	Aye, we have a tanner. He's in the center o' town.
1014152	Britain thou'rt askin' about? I'm told 'tis the biggest city in the land. Don't see what all t'fuss is about. The size of hereabouts is plenty big for me.
1014153	Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.
1014154	Healing shrines are found all about Britannia.
1014155	I know nothing of any avatar.
1014156	I may have heard a legend of a city called Wind. It was in the mountains, if I recall.
1014157	If thou'rt looking for Trinsic, 'tis south, but along the eastern coast.
1014158	I've never seen Lord British myself.
1014159	Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.
1014160	Nujel'm is an island city. Part of Britannia, but ... different.
1014161	Ocllo ... hmmm. 'Tis an island, I believe.
1014162	Our healer sets to the east side, between the two bridges. If thou seest the inn, thou hast gone too far north.
1014163	Our inn is up past the northern bridge.
1014164	Right beside the woodworker and blacksmith, thou'lt find our bathhouse.
1014165	Skara Brae? Thou canst not get more west than that!
1014166	The blacksmith is to the northwest, past the bath house.
1014167	The provisioner is southmost in town.
1014168	The tanner set up shop south of the healer.
1014169	The taverns are south, west of the provisioner.
1014170	The woodworker is next to the blacksmith.
1014171	Thou'rt in Buccaneer's Den.
1014172	Trinsic? 'Tis near the Cape of Heroes, I think.
1014173	Verity Isle is Moonglow's whereabouts. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014174	Vesper can be found on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014175	Yew ... ahh, that is near to Empath Abbey. That's the land from whence the best wine comes.
1014176	I know many virtuous people.
1014177	If thou'rt in need of medical attention, there is none better to visit than our healer on the southern side of our village.
1014178	Our armourer is a fine hand with metal and leather. Feel free to view his wares in his shop two or three doors north of the healer.
1014179	Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.
1014180	The orcs are bolder here than they dare elsewhere. They come from the fort to the south.
1014181	The orcs live safe in their fortress to the south, and when they set out, we have no warning.
1014182	This is Cove, friend. Not as fancy as a big city town, but a good place, with good people.
1014183	We have a small dock. 'Tis on the north side of town, right on the water, o'course.
1014184	A bit of action, eh? The Dueling Pit is in the center of town, of course.
1014185	Cemetery? We've got one, sadly a necessity, and it's to the far west of town.
1014186	Docks? Why, there are no less than four docks in Jhelom. One to the east of the main town, and one to the south, another on our northernmost island, and one on our southernmost isle.
1014187	Food can be most easily purveyed from the small shop a bit north and east of the town's southern docks.
1014188	If thou art looking for Jhelom's inn, it is north of the main southern docks.
1014189	I'll not ask thy business at the Thieves' Guild. 'Tis just south of the Dueling Pit, beneath the Library.
1014190	I'm told our weapons shop is one of the best. It is west and south from the Dueling Pit.
1014191	In my opinion, we have a fine woodworker. I'd call his shop south-central, though 'tis a bit to the east.
1014192	Indeed, the Fighters' Guild is in Jhelom. In fact, there are two. One is at the northern edge of the town, just west of the blacksmith. One is the farthest building south.
1014193	Jhelom is any mercenary's second home. 'Tis no finer place for selling thy sword arm. While it's still attached, at least.
1014194	Last I saw, there was a mage's shop just north of the theater. That's on the southern isle, thou knowest.
1014195	Library? We've got one, friend, and it's just south of the Dueling Pit.
1014196	Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, of course!
1014197	Our tinker is north and east of the main isle's southern gate.
1014198	Ranches are on the north-most island.
1014199	Sure, every fighter is interested in armor. My favorite is the nearest building to the eastern gate. There's another, too, at the south end of town.
1014200	The baker is north of the Weapons shop, west of the Dueling Pit.
1014201	The best place to buy fish is found just east of the Dueling Pit.
1014202	The clothes shop is to the southwest of town, betwixt the jeweler and the Thieves' Guild.
1014203	The Fisher's Guild is the most southern thing in the town, friend.
1014204	The guard tower is south of the Dueling Pit, on the far side of the library.
1014205	The Healer? Why close on to the Dueling Pit, of course!
1014206	The shipwright is nearest the town's eastern docks, but south of the armourer.
1014207	The tailor? That shop is on the southern island. It's a small island, but still Jhelom, right enough.
1014208	The Theater is on the southern isle.
1014209	Thou canst find him to the west of town, past the clothier and the Thieves' Guild.
1014210	Thou wilt find a provisioner on the eastern side of the main town, midway between northmost and southmost.
1014211	Town Hall? Find the Dueling Pits, near the center of town, then head a few paces north and east.
1014212	Town tavern? 'Tis a grand place for ale and perhaps a brawl or two. I recommend it. Head east from the Dueling Pit, and when thou smellest fish, turn right.
1014213	We do have blacksmith shops, one north of the city, just west of Town Hall, and another to the south, near the southern docks.
1014214	We have two. One south of town, and one on the southern isle.
1014215	A fine tavern is located in the southeast section of the city, near the bakery.
1014216	A small island southeast of the main city, is where the council meets in the House of Parliament.
1014217	Above the magic shop located in the southern part of the city, the mage's guild has a lovely meeting hall.
1014218	Artists are rare in Magincia. We import most of our artwork. 'Tis too much work and effort to create it ourselves.
1014219	Magic doth provide a variety of conveniences. But 'tis more a variant of technology than the manipulation of ether, that keeps our houses clean without having to work at it.
1014220	Many a great speech hath been heard in the town square in the north of the city, beside the temple.
1014221	New Magincia? 'Tis nothing wrong with this fine city ... we do not need a new one.
1014222	Parliament doth consist of a nine member council. The retiring council member hath the responsibility of appointing their replacement.
1014223	The bakery is located on the southeastern tip of the main island before you cross the bridge to Parliament.
1014224	The best tailor is located next to the shipwrights on the far southwest side of the city.
1014225	The docks are located on the far south side of the city.
1014226	The fish market is located on the city's docks, on the south side.
1014227	The healer's hall is on the westernmost street in the city, toward the southern end, near the tailor's and the fish market.
1014228	The jeweler's shop is located on the far west side of the city, between the Miner's Guild Hall and the tailor's shop.
1014229	The local inn is located nearly in the exact centre of the city. A small park lies to the north of it.
1014230	The merchants meet in the building behind the fish market. 'Tis near the docks on the south side of the city.
1014231	The miner's guild is located on the western edge of town, behind the inn.
1014232	The people of Magincia are direct descendants of those who forged the world, and one day we will inherit the world, and make our way to the stars and take our place as the rulers of all the lands below. We have good cause to be proud.
1014233	The pirates of Buccaneer's Den resent our wealth, but hath begun to raid less and less often thanks to magical items of protection purchased from Moonglow.
1014234	The provisioner shares space with the fish market. 'Tis located on the city docks on the far south end of the city.
1014235	The shipwrights, why 'tis located on the south side of the city on the docks.
1014236	The temple is located near the beach to the far north, just east of the town square.
1014237	The tinker's shop is located just south of the steps leading toward the town square on the north end of town.
1014238	There's a warehouse that stocks all kinds of goods on the east side of the city near the tinker's shop.
1014239	Thou canst purchase magical goods in the southern end of the city along the central street.
1014240	Both Miners' Guild halls are near the center of town.
1014241	Dancing is a sport in Minoc. Sometimes the music is louder than the blacksmith's anvil next door.
1014242	I do not know of a place called 'Buccaneer's Den'.
1014243	Miners' tents are east and south of town. They stay close to the mines, mostly.
1014244	Minoc is about thee. There is not much north of here, friend.
1014245	Minoc is not so large a city that we must separate the homes from the businesses. Houses are throughout the town.
1014246	Our healer's shop is in the southeastern corner of town.
1014247	Soldiers and professional fighters all gather in their hall, which is near center of town, one door south of the tavern.
1014248	Supplies are a steady business in Minoc. We have a provisioner on both the north and south sides of town.
1014249	The butcher's shop is at the very northwest corner of Minoc.
1014250	The horses are kept a bit apart from the town. The stable is north, just northeast of the tavern.
1014251	The mines are due east of town.
1014252	The tavern is in the north part of town, near to the butcher and warriors' guild.
1014253	The woodworker has a good selection of material in these parts. The shop is on the east side of town, just a bit of wander north of the tanner.
1014254	Thou'lt find our tinker in the center of Minoc.
1014255	Thou'rt lookin' for the blacksmith? The smithy is on the far side of town from the stables.
1014256	We have but one tanner, and thou'lt find the shop south, but not so far as the provisioner.
1014257	We have two guilds: the Warriors' and the Miners'.
1014258	We think pretty highly of our armourer. His shop in the southeast corner of town has brisk business.
1014259	All manner of baked goods can be found just south of the docks.
1014260	Fine armour can be had from the armoury in the center of town. Look to the west of Moonglow, to one side of the street that leads west out of town.
1014261	Fresh fruit can be had at a humble store near the center of town. It is just south of the inn, if thou'rt interested.
1014262	If it were not for the zoo in southern Moonglow, the mages would have to trek into the wilds to view these humble creatures ... and grass stains make for angry apprentices.
1014263	If thou'rt looking for the town hall, look to the southwest corner of the heart of Moonglow.
1014264	Indeed, Moonglow has several Mages' Guilds. Three in fact. One to the south, one to the east and one to the north.
1014265	Master mages are usually professors at the Lycaeum. They can be found there, or in their homes, or sometimes about the streets of Moonglow. They are usually willing to answer questions.
1014266	Moonglow was founded by Lord British to be a research colony. The Lycaeum is where the research takes place. Nearly all new magic in Britain comes from that building on the northwest peninsula.
1014267	North of the Gadgeteers' Guild is a mage scholar who will teach travelers his lore, regardless of whether they attend the Lycaeum.
1014268	Our healer is in the central part of Moonglow, on the far western side. It is but two doors away from the teleporters, and that's a good thing, I promise.
1014269	Our tailor has a central location, just across the street from the provisioner.
1014270	Reagents are quite in demand in Moonglow. There is a store devoted to their sale, close by the teleporters.
1014271	Teleporters? Well, there's one near the Lycaeum, of course, one by the zoo, one near the eastern residence section, and one near the northern houses.
1014272	The artists live near their guildhall. If thou'rt interested in visiting Moonglow's bastion of the finer arts, look to the east of the main town area. The artists are close by where the road turns northward.
1014273	The best place in Moonglow to buy supplies would be at the provisioner's shop, just south of the docks.
1014274	The butcher is across the street from the herbalist. If thou'rt lost, both meat and herbs are to the west of the central teleporters.
1014275	The cemetery is found to the south of the city. It is a small one, but strikingly serene.
1014276	The docks are easy enough to get to ... they are north of the city proper, and in betwixt the two 'prongs' that extend north into the sea.
1014277	The Gadgeteers' Guild is in the heart of the city, to the southeast of the teleporters.
1014278	The herbalist is found but one door south of the shop of reagents. Theirs customers are similar, but their businesses do not conflict as often as thou might suspect.
1014279	The inn is east a ways from the docks, a bit south. If thou sees the Artists' Guild, thou art too far east. If thou finds the scholar mage's place, thou art too far south.
1014280	There is one apprentice for each Mages' Guild. Therefore, one is to be found near the northern Guild, one near the southern Guild, and one to the east.
1014281	Thou canst guess from our city's name that our scholars are intrigued by celestial objects. In the eastern part of the city, near the shore, we have the realms' largest eyeglass pointed at the sky.
1014282	Thou should stop and take a look at the woodcarver's wares. Thou'lt find the store just north and a bit west from the main teleporter location. The skill and detail work are, I think, second to none.
1014283	We are on Verity Isle. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014284	We have a mage who deals in potions and other such things. Look a bit south of the tailor, just to the northeast of the teleporters.
1014285	And why wouldst thou be needing a cemetery? Sure, thou'rt neither so old, nor so ill? Well, thou'lt find it to the far northwest, outside the city walls.
1014286	Aye, The Silver Bow. 'Tis a bit quieter than Mystical Spirits, I'll tell that. 'Tis further from the casino than Mystical Spirits, just south of the concert hall. Draws a milder crowd.
1014287	Dost thou mean the gazebo? The little open-air wooden structure on the southeast side of town? 'Tis between The Silver Bow tavern and Restful Slumber inn.
1014288	If the idea of a human chessboard appeals to thee, thou'lt find ours at the southern end of the road through the center of town, past the town manor and the inn.
1014289	If thou seekst to buy or sell goods, most tradespeople keep shops in the mall at the far west end of town. If thou'rt merely hungry, thou canst get a good meal at The Silver Bow or Mystical Spirits.
1014290	If thou'rt in search of sustenance, thou'lt find two taverns in the east of town - Mystical Spirits and the Silver Bow.
1014291	If thou'rt looking to buy or sell something, there's a mall to the west of the city, where thou'lt find almost everything - blacksmith, boyer, weaponsmith, tanner, food and supplies.
1014292	Needst thou a tailor? Thou canst not find one better than ours ... Thou'lt find the shop along the eastern edge of town, next door to the Mystical Spirits tavern.
1014293	Our inn is called Restful Slumber, and 'tis fairly true to name. Thou'lt find it in the southeastern quarter of town, neighboring The Silver Bow tavern. I wish a pleasant stay.
1014294	Seek'st thou a gaming house? The try the casino in the northeast quarter, next door to the Mystical Spirits. I think thou'lt find Nujel'm lives up to her reputation.
1014295	So, 'tis the merchant's guild thou'lt be seeking? Art interested in trade in human flesh, then? For that's what thou'lt find there. 'Tis at the southern tip of town, next the jail.
1014296	The jeweler's shop is in the northeast corner of town, east of the conservatory and north of the casino.
1014297	There's but one bank in Nujel'm, and it lies in the southeastern quarter of town, not too far from the human chessboard.
1014298	Thou'lt find the customs house overlooking the northeast bay. 'Tis inside the city walls, next door to the concert hall.
1014299	Thou'lt find the jail near the merchant's guild, south of the human chessboard. I'd be wary if I wert thee - 'tis one thing to be on this side of the bars down there, but 'tis a nightmare on the other.
1014300	Thou'lt find the Mystical Spirits on the eastern edge of town, next door to the casino. But if thou permit me to say, I prefer The Silver Bow, which is just a few paces south of it. Better atmosphere.
1014301	Travelers from less civilized towns often mistake the large building in the center of town for a palace. But, 'tis merely a manor house, and the man who lords over it made his fortune here in Nujel'm.
1014302	We have both a renowned conservatory and concert hall. Thou'lt find both to the north of town, between the customs house and the casino.
1014303	Wilt thou hear sweet music? We have a beautiful concert hall in the north of the city, next door to the customs house. There's a conservatory for bards across the street, should you wish to study further.
1014304	All manner of clothing can be found on the mainland side. The tailor's shop is just west from the stables.
1014305	I've been pleased with our armourer's work. Look for the shop called 'Serpent's Arms', just east of the healer.
1014306	Our provisioner can set thee up with supplies. Look just to the north of the blacksmith.
1014307	'Serpent's Hold Meats' is on the shore of the mainland, east of the bridge.
1014308	Serpent's Hold, thou hast found, is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes.
1014309	The blacksmith works in one of the large buildings central in the Hold. The smithy is the northernmost of the two.
1014310	The heart of Serpent's Hold is the Keep. It is the largest building on the island, in the northwest corner.
1014311	The inn is on the west side of the island, close to the main gate.
1014312	The stables are on the mainland side of Serpent's Hold, betwixt the tailor and the tinker.
1014313	The tavern faces the healer's shop, immediately on thy left as thou comes in over the bridge.
1014314	The tinker's place is on the mainland. Thou'lt find it closest to the bridge.
1014315	Thou'lt find the healer's place between the armoury and the tavern. 'Tis sometimes crowded, especially right after training.
1014316	Cartographer's are usually found sharing space with shipwrights.
1014317	Farmers come into town, but their crops are all a bit over on the mainland.
1014318	Just north of the healer is where our blacksmith keeps shop.
1014319	Not settling down, I take it. Thou'lt find the provisioner to the northwest of the inn.
1014320	Our fair city of Skara Brae is the central hub for all the westward sea expeditions.
1014321	Our healer is close to the east dock.
1014322	Our inn is at the south end of the isle, near the docks, o'course.
1014323	Our theatre is on the northern edge of town, just a bit north and east of the beekeeper.
1014324	The alchemist's shop is the very most northeast place in town.
1014325	The animal trainer sets up shop just north of the beekeeper. They are much the same thing, to my mind.
1014326	The armourer is toward the center of town, but off a bit to the north-west.
1014327	The beekeeper has a shop toward the north of town, just south of the theatre.
1014328	The bowyer is north and a little west of the inn. In my opinion, the work is excellent.
1014329	The butcher shop is in the midst of town, betwixt the tavern and the magic shop.
1014330	The clothier keeps his shop on the east shore, three doors north of the dock.
1014331	The rangers' guildhall is on the west side of the isle. 'Tis north of the tavern and Town Hall, y'know.
1014332	The tavern sits on the western shore. It is just north of Town Hall
1014333	There is a shop of gentle magics, and that's a fact. 'Tis very near the exact center of town.
1014334	This is fine country for growing food. Our farmers sell at a shop near the northern edge of town, toward the middle and just south of the theatre.
1014335	Thou hast a choice. There is one guild on the northwest side of town, and another just across the water to the east.
1014336	Town Hall, eh? Well, and I hope thou bring no trouble to our fair isle. Walk west and south to get there.
1014337	Weapons can be had from the shop in the north-east corner of town.
1014338	We've a fine shipwright, close on to the southernmost dock.
1014339	Woodcrafter? That shop is toward the north of town, center between the weaponsmith and the farmers' shop.
1014340	Any thieves or other such riffraff are incarcerated in the Constabulary, just north of the Traveler's Gate.
1014341	Fine gems are the trade of our master jeweler, who has set up shop on the south side of our commercial district, neighboring the baker and the healer.
1014342	If thou hast a mind to see a tinker, the shop is in the southern part of the city ... just follow the river up to where it enters the city, and thou'lt find the place.
1014343	If thou'rt looking for the Fishers' Guild, go to the farthest part of the city to the southeast. The guildhall is next to the fish market.
1014344	Our baker is in the southern part of the city, just to the south and east of the Traveler's Gate.
1014345	Our Engineers' Guild is in the northwest corner of town.
1014346	Our provisioner's shop is the first thing one sees coming into the city. 'Tis the large building to the south of the entrance gate.
1014347	The armour shop is north of the monastery and mayor's house. I think you'll be pleased with the selection.
1014348	The butcher's shop is in the southeast corner of Trinsic.
1014349	The Guild of Engineers meets in their hall in the northwest section of town.
1014350	The mayor lives in the north side of town, betwixt the armourer and the monastery.
1014351	The monastery is renowned for its serene gardens. 'Tis on thy left as thou comes into the city.
1014352	The knights meet in their guildhall, found on the eastern side of their island.
1014353	The knights who live in Trinsic call the barracks home. They are in the northern part of the eastern half of town.
1014354	The stables are just a pace to the west of the inn.
1014355	The tailor's shop is a bit apart from the others. It is a bit south and east of the river's fork.
1014356	The tavern is just west of the fork in the river.
1014357	There's a good weaponsmith in the center of town, just a few paces south of the Soldier's Gate.
1014358	There's a guild or two in Trinsic. The Fisher Guild is to the southeast, and the Engineer's Guild is to the northwest. The Knights' Guild is on their island, of course.
1014359	Thou'rt in Trinsic, of course, near the Cape of Heroes we are.
1014360	Thou'rt looking to train? The training salle is just inside the Soldier's Gate.
1014361	To find the shrine, simply walk to the point most north and east of town. 'Tis close to the water.
1014362	We have a very fine mage indeed. Thou canst find him just north of the inn, above the Traveler's Gate.
1014363	We have but one healer, and too far a walk from the training grounds, to my mind. If thou hast wounds, look to the south of the commercial district.
1014364	We have guardhouses at most strategic locations: especially wall corners with good visibility.
1014365	We have two inns, one at the easternmost part of town, and one in the west, a bit to the north.
1014366	You can't get fish fresher than at our fish market. It is outside the city gates, on the sea side.
1014367	Customs is in the very southeast part of Vesper.
1014368	I can tell thee that our mage buys reagents from the reagent shop near the docks. The stuff comes from all over, and Vesper gets first pick-through.
1014369	I hope thou hast had no trouble in Vesper, friend. The town hall is a southern island, one door south of the warriors' guild.
1014370	If I knew there was a thieves guild, I'd tell the guards first!
1014371	If thou'rt in need of armour, look on the central westernmost island of Vesper.
1014372	If thou'rt looking for potions, the shop thou needest is to the far north of Vesper, on the same island as the Jeweler.
1014373	Lookin' for the Bards' Guild? 'Tis the southernmost building on the northernmost island of Vesper.
1014374	On a lazy afternoon I like to wander around in Vesper's museum. It is the large building east of the tanner.
1014375	On the centermost island, farthest to the east, thou canst find the Seaman's guild.
1014376	On the western shore, at the southern end of Vesper, is an inn. It is much the same as the inn on the south-central island.
1014377	Our bank is on the northmost island. Look for the jeweler and the painter's studio.
1014378	Our healer has trained with the best, friend, as will be more than able to ease thy suffering. Look on a small island, just one bridge east of the blacksmith, or one bridge south of the woodworker.
1014379	Our mortuary and crypts are on the western bank, north of the inn.
1014380	Our tinker's shop can be found on a central island, somewhat north.
1014381	The baker's place is on the island just north of the docks.
1014382	The bee hives are kept on a small islet at the northeast. 'Tis north of the butcher and baker, and east of the painter's studio.
1014383	The best artist's studio, and by coincidence the only one, is on the northern isle, near the guild houses.
1014384	The farmer brings his produce in from the fields and sells it from his shop on the island just north of the docks.
1014385	The jeweler keeps shop on the northern island, betwixt the miners' and bards' guild halls.
1014386	The shipwright is the nearest building to the docks, o'course!
1014387	The soldiers and fighters gather in their hall on the large southern island.
1014388	The tailor is on the eastern shore of the river. Take the bridge from the northern isle and then go south.
1014389	The tanner is one bridge away from shore, at the point farthest south of the city.
1014390	The tavern is on one of the southern islands, I believe toward the center. I see it when I run errands to the customs house.
1014391	The woodworker's shop can be found but one bridge north of the healer's island.
1014392	There are a fair number of sorcerers here, and that's a fact. They meet in the upper floors of their hall on the north island.
1014393	There are mages who will sell their talents, true enough. Merely look on the ground floor of their guildhall on the north island.
1014394	There is naught but fresh fish in Vesper, and 'tis easiest had from the fisherman's shop. Look near the baker and butcher's places.
1014395	There's a fine tailor's shop in Vesper. Look to the largest southern island, in the building just north of the warriors' guildhouse.
1014396	Thou might try one of the center islands, away to the west. Methinks I've seen a bowyer's sign hanging there.
1014397	Thou'lt be wanting supplies, I take it? The provisioner keeps a shop to the north of town, on the shore.
1014398	Thou'lt find the blacksmith on the largest of the southern isles.
1014399	Thou'lt find the Miners' Guildhouse on the northernmost island, just where the river breaks around Vesper.
1014400	Thou'rt looking for the butcher, I take it. Get thee to the docks, then take the bridge north from that island. The butcher is the first building thou'lt see.
1014401	Vesper, thou canst see, is on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014402	Food is a necessity, but certainly nothing to waste time over. Our communal eating area is to the far east of Wind.
1014403	If thou needest a healer, look to the eastern central part of wind. 'Tis close by the food place, if thou knowest where that is, but farther south and west.
1014404	Inns are scattered throughout Wind. One is northwest, one is northeast, and one is south.
1014405	Labs are places of study and discovery. We've one to the northwest of Wind, and one to the east.
1014406	Lord British became ruler of the united realm of Britannia when he wrested control from the 'evil' Lord Robert. The stories that are mostly known are, of course, mostly apocryphal.
1014407	Lord British is the ruler of Britannia. He seems a kind and just king, trying to do the right thing for his people.
1014408	Magincia is an island city east of Britain. It is all pride and foolishness, for it has never known deprivation.
1014409	Minoc is in the northmost part of the realm, a bit to the east. It is in the mountains, and is economically dependent on the nearby ore mines.
1014410	Moonglow is on the southern tip of Verity isle, and is a very logical place. They buy other cities' technology and examine it to see how it works. Laudable.
1014411	Our libraries are filled with scholars grazing on information. Look to the center of Wind for our collected tomes of knowledge.
1014412	Our only supply of reagents are sold in the central part of Wind. Look close by the libraries, in the same general location of the healer.
1014413	Serpent's Hold is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes. It is where all the fighters of Britannia are trained.
1014414	Skara Brae is on an island due west of Britain. They study a mental form of magic that is unusual for that part of the world.
1014415	Tailor made clothes and repairs thou canst find at the tailor's shop, east of the provisioner.
1014416	This is Wind, of course. We study all manner of things: magic, the world, the inexplicable self.
1014417	Thou canst purchase thy supplies from the provisioner, found south and west from the northwestern inn.
1014418	Yew is in the northwest region of Britannia. It is home to the Empath Abbey where the famous wine is made.
1014419	Fresh meat can be had from the butcher, in the clearing at the center of Yew.
1014420	Fresh vegetables and other nourishing foods are sold at the market in the center of town. Look for a shop close by the butcher and baker.
1014421	If thou hast grain to be milled, take it to the flour mill just a bit west of the Abbey.
1014422	If thou'rt handy with a bow and arrows, then surely thou'lt be interested in our bowyer's excellent work. Look in his shop at the center of town ... there a selection that'll make thy head spin.
1014423	It was decided a long time ago that local judges would sit on the High Court. If thou wishes to see the court, head west and north of town. I cannot say if there is a trial in progress, however.
1014424	The cemetery is to the south and east of town.
1014425	The healers in Yew are specialized in natural cures. There are at least two in town: one is southeast and one is central.
1014426	The monks in the abbey that lies to the northeast spend their time studying painting, sculpting, prose, poetry, music ... and wine.
1014427	The prison is past the High Court to the northwest ... although it is not a common tourist site. Usually people come here for the wine.
1014428	The vineyards and winery are just south of the abbey, to the east of the flour mill and across the little inlet.
1014429	There is a prison storehouse between the High Court and the prison.
1014430	We do have a baker, and a fine one at that. To find the bakery, find the market near the center of Yew. The baker hangs his sign between that of the butcher and the woodworker.
1014431	Yew is famous for its wood crafts. There is a woodwork shop near the bakery, just a bit south of the bowyer.
1014432	Yew, thou hast found, is in the northwest region of Britannia.
1014433	Dost thou need to improve thy alchemy? Sure, I might be able to teach thee.
1014434	I am an alchemist.
1014435	I train animals.
1014436	I am an architect.
1014437	I'm an armourer.
1014438	I've been known to teach some how to improve their skills, for a few coins.
1014439	I am an artist.
1014440	Yes, I'm the baker. How can I help thee?
1014441	I am a Banker.
1014442	I am a bard. A minstrel. A thoughtful troubadour.
1014443	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014444	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014445	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014446	I'm a beekeeper.
1014447	I'm between jobs at the moment. But if thou couldst find it in thine heart to help out a soul in need, I'm sure that my luck will change!
1014448	I've been a smith for a good number of years.
1014449	I'm a bowyer by trade.
1014450	I am sort of like a porter. I lighten the burdens of rich travelers.
1014451	I am a butcher.
1014452	I'm the carpenter here.
1014453	I can give thee some practice in carpentry, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014454	A Cashual is one who has a deep understanding of the practical applications of natural philosophy.
1014455	I can give thee some practice in our art, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014456	I'm a cobbler.
1014457	Fare thee well.
1014458	Goodbye, stranger.
1014459	May the rest of thy day be pleasant.
1014460	Thou wishest to speak with me?
1014461	Thou hast mine attention.
1014462	What is it thou wishest?
1014463	I am listening to thee.
1014464	I am a cook and baker.
1014465	I've been known to teach some how to improve their cookin', for a few coins.
1014466	Pardon me?,
1014467	Excuse me?,
1014468	I do not understand.
1014469	I beg thee, do not harm me. I cannot help thee.
1014470	I do not understand thee--I am sure it must be my fault, however.
1014471	Begging thy pardon, but I fail to understand what it is that thou wantest.
1014472	I wish I could answer thee, so that thou wouldst leave me alone.
1014473	Excuse my incomprehension, oh mighty terrorizer of small children, but I did not understand thee, and would find life more pleasant without thy ilk nearby.
1014474	I am sorry, but I do not always understand the utterances of petty criminals.
1014475	Forgive me, but I do not understand.
1014476	Excuse me? Forgive my lack of comprehension.
1014477	If I look perplexed, 'tis because I am.
1014478	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014479	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014480	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014481	Begging thy pardon, but in my awe at seeing thee actually here before me, I neglected to listen closely to what thou spoke.
1014482	Sadly, I must report that I know nothing of what thou speakest.
1014483	Help me to understand thee, for I know not what thou seekest.
1014484	I am a simple farmer. I raise crops.
1014485	I am paid to fight!,
1014486	I've been known to teach a select few how to improve their fighting, for a few coins.
1014487	I am a fisherman.
1014488	I can give thee some fishing tips, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And I do expect to be paid for my time.
1014489	My trade is selling pelts of all sorts.
1014490	I can teach thee about the animals in the forest and how to know more about them, if thou art willing.
1014491	I'm a gamer by trade.  The cards and dice are my partners.
1014492	I could show thee a few things that the local guard wouldn't much take to, I'm sure.
1014493	I'm a glassblower.
1014494	Greetings.  What might I do for thee?,
1014495	Greetings.  What might I help thee with?,
1014496	Yes?,
1014497	Hello, my friend!  How may I assist thee?,
1014498	Hello!
1014499	I am a guard.
1014500	I'm a wanderer, and take whatever fortune offers me.
1014501	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about such things as camping in the wild. Or not being seen when thou dost not WANT to be seen. Thou wouldst need to pay me, thou knowest.
1014502	I am one of the many healers of Britannia. I also sell potions and healing scrolls.
1014503	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about first aid. I could teach thee, also, about the human anatomy. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014504	I sell many fragrant dried herbs and flowers.
1014505	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee some alchemy skills. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014506	I have some horses here that I could sell to thee.
1014507	I am an innkeeper.
1014508	I am an innkeeper.
1014509	Thy nearness offends me.
1014510	Stand back, I do not wish to be seen so near to thee.
1014511	I'm the jailkeeper.
1014512	I'm a maker of fine jewelry.
1014513	I'm a judge of the High Court of Britannia.
1014514	I am a laborer, and working is how I spend my days.
1014515	I am a wizard, a weaver of spells.
1014516	If thou dost need help with thy magic, just ask me to teach thee and I will. For a small price.
1014517	I am a mapmaker. Wouldst thou like to learn to make maps? In theory, 'tis simple - find a blank map, go to the spot thou wouldst map, and map it. In practice, of course, this requires a bit of skill ...
1014518	If thou dost need help with thy mapmaking, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will.
1014519	If thou hast guild business, thou may bring it to me. I am the guildmaster.
1014520	I'm the mayor, friend. Welcome to our fair city!,
1014521	I am a miller.
1014522	I work in the mines.
1014523	I am a minter.
1014524	I'm a brother at Empath Abbey.
1014525	I'm doing well enough, now.
1014526	Things seem to be going well.
1014527	No no no, a job is for those who lack money!  Nobility doesn't take jobs.
1014528	I'm the pit overseer.
1014529	I am a Knight of Sosaria!,
1014530	I am a member of Parliament.
1014531	I live on the sea.  'Tis no job, but a life!,
1014532	I am a humble servant of the Gods.
1014533	I'm a prisoner!  Can't thou see that?,
1014534	I sell general provisions.
1014535	I'm a cattle rancher.
1014536	I am a ranger. I spend most of my days in the woods, observing and tracking animals. I hunt that I may eat, and try to live in harmony with the land.
1014537	Tracking is more of an art than a science, but it begins with a thorough knowledge of the traits and habits of the creature being tracked. I can help thee with that, I think.
1014538	I am the realtor for this town. If thou desires a domicile of thy own, I can help thee.
1014539	And hello again. How may I help thee, _Name_?
1014540	And hello to thee, again.
1014541	I am a message carrier.  Pardon me, I need to be running.
1014542	I'm a sailor, my friend!,
1014543	Ah, this will be useful.
1014544	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014545	I've been needing one of these.
1014546	This will come in handy indeed.
1014547	Well, look what I found!
1014548	I study ancient times and ancient tomes.
1014549	I'm a humble scrivener.
1014550	I'm a sculptor.
1014551	I serve the needs of Magincian nobles.
1014552	I tend to the sheep and keep them safe.
1014553	I'm a shipwright.
1014554	I am a _Job_.  What wouldst thou expect me to sell?,
1014555	If thou art interested in selling an item to me, then thou must give it to me and I'll decide if I need it in my stock. Otherwise, thou can buy anything that I sell here.
1014556	I'm a tailor.
1014557	I am sure I can break my busy schedule to lend thee some instruction, assuming thou hast some coin.
1014558	I am a tanner in this fine town.
1014559	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014560	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014561	Aye. I have been called thief, rogue and rapscallion and some things far worse, as I am sure thou hast been. Let us not say that again for others might hear and recognize us.
1014562	I'm a tinker.
1014563	It will take a steady hand and a sure eye to be a tinker. If thou art willing to learn, then I can help thee.
1014564	Why I am a veterinarian.
1014565	I serve food.
1014566	I am one of the many wandering healers of Britannia.
1014567	If thou dost need help with first aid, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will. For a small price.
1014568	I'm a smith.
1014569	I am a weapons trainer.
1014570	I'm a weaver.

1040023	You have been knocked off of your mount!
1040024	You are still too dazed from being knocked off your mount to ride!

1046039	Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.
1046040	Uzeraan says:  Hello! I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan. I have a few tasks for you to perform.
1046041	You have arrived not a moment too soon, stranger.  Terrible things have happened and we need your help!
1046042	This island has been plagued with foul creatures ever since the mysterious dark force began its invasion.
1046043	I know we have just met, but our need is dire and I must ask of you a favor.
1046044	For some time now, our hunters have been disappearing in the forests of this island.
1046045	We believe vile 'Shadow Wisps' are responsible for these disappearances.
1046046	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046047	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Shadow Wisps'.
1046048	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.  He is no doubt eagerly awaiting your return.
1046049	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046050	Uzeraan gives you a somber look and begins to speak slowly:
1046051	You bring sad news stranger and I fear our men may be lost forever. They will be mourned.
1046052	You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Shadow Wisps'. I am pleased.
1046053	For your efforts I have placed a small token of my appreciation in your backpack.
1046054	Unfortunately, I have more disturbing news. We once had an underground cavern that we used for mining ore.
1046055	It seems horrible creatures have been emerging from the caves at night, terrorizing the villagers.
1046056	In their folly, a mob of frightened villagers collapsed the entrance to the mining cave.
1046057	The villagers did not know that I had recently installed a teleporter in the cave.  It was designed to give the workers a quick way to return home from the cave.
1046058	What's worse is that this teleporter only goes one way: Out of the cave, into our village.
1046059	The horrid phantasms still haunt us on a nightly basis using MY teleporter to get here. We have no way to get into the cave!
1046060	Well - there is one way. Let me tell you something of magic travel...
1046061	MAGIC TRAVEL:
1046062	To begin with, you need what is called a recall rune.  Blank recall runes can be purchased at most any magic supply shop.
1046063	Then, you need either in your spellbook, or inscribed on a scroll a 'Mark' spell. 'Tis a spell of the 6th circle.
1046064	You then cast the Mark spell and target the recall rune. This inscribes the rune with the location at which you are standing.
1046065	To instantly return to the location where the rune was marked, you employ the 'Recall' spell.
1046066	This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.
1046067	Simply cast the Recall spell and target the marked recall rune of the location you wish to travel to.
1046068	There is also another, called 'Gate Travel' which operates on the same principles as the Recall spell.
1046069	Gate Travel allows you to open a magical gate to the location of your marked recall rune. This way, others can travel with you.
1046070	Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.
1046071	Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.
1046072	This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.
1046073	Unfortunately, to cast any spell, one must have the necessary reagents. Reagents that I do not have.
1046074	My supply of Mandrake Root has run dry and so I cannot cast any of the magic travel spells needed to enter the cave.
1046075	I must ask of you to go and gather Mandrake Root for me.  Try the reagent shops if you have money, or find another way if you do not.
1046076	I have no money for reagents to give you at this time, but be assured that I will repay you.
1046077	Please hurry - time is short and so is our supply of fighters to fend off the wicked creatures.
1046078	Uzeraan nods at you with approval and begins to speak:
1046079	Thank you stranger. You are not a moment too soon. For your help I have placed a few scrolls in your pack to aid you.
1046080	Just a few Mark and Recall scrolls for you to try out. I've also given you some blank recall runes.
1046081	Now I can send the few remaining soldiers in to the cave to investigate the state of affairs.
1046082	On second thought, *YOU* would do much better against the wretched wraiths than any of our soldiers.
1046083	Go and gather any other supplies you think you will need and then return here. I will transport you below upon your return.
1046084	I was beginning to think you would not return. I am glad to see that I was mistaken.
1046085	Go now into the caves below and find out what you can about the creatures coming from there.
1046086	Slay 6 of the creatures and gather any information on their weaknesses that you can.
1046087	Remember that there is a teleporter somewhere in the cave that will lead back to the surface.
1046088	Mission Complete.  You have slain the restless souls as instructed. Return to Uzeraan to report.
1046089	Uzeraan looks very disturbed at your report.  After a long silence he speaks to you:
1046090	It seems the caves are lost to us as the restless souls you describe have made it their new home.
1046091	The villagers wanted me to thank you for your help and have given me some items to reward you with.
1046092	I have placed some reagents, a few scrolls and some gold in your pack.
1046093	The issue of the restless souls requires more investigation, but alas, a more pressing matter has surfaced.
1046094	My friend and associate, Aegis The Archmage of Moonglow, has been secretly working on a new spell formula.
1046095	The new spell would easily swing the tides in our favor in the battle against this unknown evil that has befallen us.
1046096	Apparently, many of Aegis' apprentices have been getting abducted in an attempt to force information from them.
1046097	I have just received word from Aegis that one of his most trusted students was taken!
1046098	We must send someone to find the apprentice and free him before he is slain! Time is limited!
1046099	You, dear friend, have proven yourself worthy of such a quest.  I have sent word to Aegis that I will send you to aid him.
1046100	Go and gather any supplies you may need for your journey. Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046101	Excellent. You have returned.  I will transport you to Moonglow now.
1046102	Upon your arrival, follow the path North and you will find Moonglow.
1046103	Aegis runs a reagent shop west of the teleporter park within the Moonglow city walls.
1046104	If you have any trouble finding it, ask other adventurers around you and I am sure someone will aid you.
1046105	Good luck, young mage. I hope you succeed. May the aethers have mercy upon us if you do not.
1046106	You have found Aegis!
1046107	The Archmage's face lights up as he spots you in the doorway.
1046108	Thank the heavens! Uzeraan said he would send someone, but I did not expect you so soon.
1046109	As I am sure Uzeraan has told you, one of my apprentices was abducted.
1046110	’Tis a bad omen, as this was one of the few apprentices who knew of my new spell formulas.
1046111	No doubt the mysterious dark force is behind the abduction of my most valuable student.
1046112	I must ask you to go after the evil undead that abducted my apprentice and return him to safety.
1046113	In their haste to escape, one of the abductors dropped a marked recall rune.
1046114	No doubt it leads to the place where they are holding my young wizard captive.
1046115	I have the rune right here. No?  Maybe in this pocket? No. Well - this is most embarrassing.
1046116	Go and fetch yourself some supplies for the forthcoming battle and I will continue my search for the rune.
1046117	Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the rune yet. Please return in a few minutes. I will keep looking.
1046118	My ancestors smile upon me. I have found the rune to the prison camp.  With this rune we can find the lost apprentice.
1046119	I will transport you now to the location that was inscribed on this rune. I pray it takes you to my student wizard.
1046120	Slay his captors and release him from his bondage. Take these scrolls with you - they will help.
1046121	They are scrolls with the 'Unlock' spell inscribed upon them.  This spell can be very useful.
1046122	Remember however, that the Unlock spell only unlocks things that were locked using the 'Magic Lock' spell.
1046123	Also keep in mind that not only doors can be locked with the lock spell, but also containers of all sorts.
1046124	Now go. Time is short!  Return here when you have saved my apprentice.
1046125	Quest Complete! You have saved the apprentice.  Return to Aegis and speak with him.
1046126	Aegis smiles at you with a look of great satisfaction.
1046127	Well done young Mage!!!  Stay on the path of virtue and continue your lessons in the arcane arts.
1046128	I foresee that you will become a mighty spell wielder who will gain many honors throughout Britannia.
1046129	I thank you for saving my apprentice and therein saving our cause. I feel a reward is in order.
1046130	Gold is also always welcome I think, so here is a check for 1000 gold. Don't squander it now, ye hear?
1046131	Take this magical wizard's hat. It tends to be rough on the body, but does wonders for the mind.
1046132	I hope we meet again in the future my friend. I am indebted to you always.
1046133	Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.
1046134	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046135	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046136	Find 75 Mandrake roots and return them to Uzeraan. Try checking the local reagent shops.
1046137	Gather supplies for battle and return to Uzeraan when you are ready.
1046138	Venture into the mining cave and slay 6 of the restless souls. Use the teleporter in the cave to return.
1046139	Find the teleporter in the cave and return to Uzeraan.
1046140	Gather any supplies you need and return to Uzeraan when you are ready to leave for Moonglow.
1046141	Find Aegis the Archmage in the city of Moonglow. His shop is west of the teleporter park.
1046142	Explore the town and gather supplies for battle. Return to Aegis when you are ready.
1046143	Check in with Aegis after a while to see if he has recovered the rune to the prison camp.
1046144	Find the prison camp where the abducted apprentice is being held. Slay his oppressors and free him.
1046145	Return to Aegis and tell him you have freed his apprentice.
1046146	Uzeraan lives in his mansion within the city of Haven.  Find him and he will give you instructions on tasks he would like you to do for him.
1046147	Uzeraan explains tasks for you to become a better blacksmith.  He has requested that you find an anvil and forge.
1046148	Uzeraan says: Hello!  I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan.  I have a few tasks I'd like you to perform.
1046149	These tasks will help you to become a better blacksmith and make tools to aid your smithing.  The tasks are not pointless, as an army needs the weapons and armor you make.
1046150	First, I would like you to find an anvil and forge.  The anvils and forges can be found on this floor of my mansion.
1046151	Forge a ringmail tunic with your smithy hammer or tongs.  Uzeraan has more information, once you make the ringmail tunic.
1046152	At the forge and anvil, you craft the items of your blacksmithing trade.  To protect yourself, you should craft a ringmail tunic.
1046153	To use an anvil and forge, you must be standing next to them.  An anvil and forge allows you to use tongs or a hammer.
1046154	The tongs or hammer you use are in your backpack or hand. Double-clicking the tongs or hammer should bring up a menu to allow you to blacksmith.
1046155	If you are too far from the anvil and forge, you will not get the menu.  If you do not have enough ingots in your backpack for the item you want to smith, then you will not be able to make it.
1046156	Visit Uzeraan once you have made your ringmail tunic.
1046157	Uzeraan explains why you need the ringmail tunic for protection.  The mountains south of the mansion have ore to mine, but may have a critter or two that are hostile.
1046158	Uzeraan says: Now that you have made a ringmail tunic, you will need more ingots to supply yourself for future armor and weapons you make.  Ingots are made from ore that you mine off of mountains.
1046159	There are mountains to the south of my mansion.  They may be dangerous, so make sure to wear your ringmail tunic before you leave.
1046160	Once you find the mountains, you can mine them with your trusty shovel or pickaxe.
1046161	Once you have completed mining five large iron ore piles from mountains or caves, visit Uzeraan.  There are four types of ore piles, the largest pile smelts for the most ingots.
1046162	To mine ore, you will need to use your shovel or pickaxe on the mountainside or on a cave floor.  Double-clicking the shovel or pickaxe allows you to use the item.  You can then target the mountain or cave floor.
1046163	If an area is out of ore, you will need to hunt further along a mountainside or in a cave for more spots to mine at.  Simply use your digging tool on different areas of the stone until you get some ore.
1046164	Ore comes in varying sizes.  The smaller the pile, the fewer ingots it will make when it is smelted.  You will need five large piles of iron ore to smelt into the ingots you need.
1046165	Uzeraan's forge can be used to smelt ore into iron ingots.  Those ingots can be used to make tools.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ore.
1046166	Smelt ore in town at the forge for iron ingots.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ingots.
1046167	Uzeraan says: Now that you have the five piles of ore, you will need to smelt them.  The forge allows you to smelt ore.
1046168	Once you find the forge, double-click the piles of ore and target the red coals of the forge.  The ore will be smelted into ingots, if you are close enough to the forge.
1046169	When you have made the iron ingots, visit Uzeraan and he will instruct you on how to make more pickaxes.
1046170	Make two pickaxes for mining with your tinker kit.  Show Uzeraan a pickaxe by giving it to him.
1046171	Shovels and pickaxes break fairly often while mining.  This means you will need to make pickaxes with the ingots you mine up
1046172	To make a couple of pickaxes, you can use your tinker tools on your ingots.  Select the pickaxe from the tinker menu and it will be made from the ingots you selected.
1046173	You can make these pickaxes anywhere, as long as you have the ingots.  This means if you ever run out of pickaxes while mining a mountainside, you can make more pickaxes right away!
1046174	Make fifty iron ingots for the mansion.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed making the ingots.
1046175	Uzeraan says:  Now that you know how to keep your pickaxes in good supply and how to make iron ingots, I happen to be in need of a large pile of ingots.
1046176	Please make fifty ingots and bring them to me.  I will buy them from you for five-hundred gold.
1046177	Iron ore piles are heavy.  You will need to lug piles of ore you mine back to the mansion to smelt them into iron ingots.  This may take you a few trips back and forth between the mountains and the forge.
1046178	Once you have completed the ingots, visit me for your payment.
1046179	Uzeraan describes the order deeds the armourers need in Minoc.  Find the moongate at the south-east part of town.  This moongate will take you to a location just outside of Minoc.
1046180	Uzeraan says: You have done very well.  You know how to supply yourself with iron ingots and pickaxes.
1046181	Now, I have a more advanced task for you.  The city armourers of Minoc are in need of weapons and armor.  I have placed their order deeds in your backpack for you to fulfill.
1046182	To get to the city of Minoc, you will need to travel through the moongate.  The moongate is located to the south-east of town, towards the mountains.
1046183	The moongate allows you to travel to far destinations.  Select Trammel and then Minoc and accept the menu and it will whisk you away.  Once there, walk west towards the road.
1046184	Now that you have found the moongate, you should walk into it.  A menu will appear asking where you wish to travel to.
1046185	There are two types of moongates.  Moongates, such as the one you just found, are scattered through the world and offer menus of different locations.
1046186	The other type of moongate does not offer a menu.  It is a moongate that powerful mages may temporarily create to allow themselves and others to pass through them to marked locations.
1046187	If you cannot walk into the moongate, you may double-click it to use it.  If you are too far from the moongate, you cannot use the moongate.
1046188	Besides allowing you to travel between locations, you may use a moongate to go to another facet.  The two facets are Felucca and Trammel.
1046189	The city of Haven is in Trammel.  If you wish to travel back to Haven, you would need to select Trammel before selecting it as the city you wish to visit.
1046190	To visit Minoc, you may visit it in either Trammel or Felucca.  Although, the armourers that need the weapons and armor are in Trammel.
1046191	Select Trammel as the facet you wish to visit and then select Minoc as the city.
1046192	The city of Minoc is a city of miners, tinkerers, and jewelers.  Minoc is to the north-northwest.  The mountains are north-east of Minoc.  You need to complete the order deeds in Minoc.
1046193	Minoc is to the north-west of the gate you have just exited from.  There is a road to the west that leads north into town.
1046194	The armourers have two shops in town.  They both have forges and anvils in them that you can use to make the weapons and armor in your order deeds.
1046195	If you pass through town, the mountains are to the north-east of Minoc.  You can use those mountains to mine the ore you need for ingots and blacksmithing.
1046196	The grey order deeds can be double-clicked to open them up and read what the amount and type of items are needed by the armourers.  Forge the items as you did for the ringmail tunic earlier with your blacksmithing hammer.
1046197	Use the combine button in the opened deed window to combine your finished products with the deed.  When you have finished the amount the orders are for, drag the deed onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.
1046198	After the deeds have all been completed, travel through the moongate to Haven and find Uzeraan.
1046199	Once you have completed the deeds, Uzeraan will grant you a reward.
1046200	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1046201	You have requested to cancel your quest.  Once you have cancelled your quest, you cannot start the young player quest again.  Do you wish to cancel your quest?
1046202	Now I can finally return to my family.  Will you go and tell Aegis that I am free and that I did not give away the secret of the new spell.
1046203	I have some unfinished business before I can return home.  Fare thee well kind adventurer.
1046204	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 35 of each reagent.
1046205	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 50 of each reagent.
1046206	We believe the vile 'Headless' are responsible for these disappearances.
1046207	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046208	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Headless'.
1046209	You however, have shown great valor in your battle against the 'Headless'!
1046210	Well there is *ONE* way - Yes! That is it. Whilst I was installing the teleporter I marked a recall rune in the cave!
1046211	I can use this recall rune to transport you directly into the caverns. Alas, you must find your own way out.
1046212	Go and gather supplies for battle. I suggest you take your weapon, some armor and at least 25 bandages to be safe.
1046213	Return here when you are ready to depart and I will transport you into the caverns below the island.
1046214	It's a treasure map I received from a dragon tamer a long time ago. I have neither the time nor the patience to find the treasure.
1046215	Take the treasure map and this shovel.  Double click the treasure map, located in your pack, to see where the treasure is. X marks the spot.
1046216	I can teleport you close to where the treasure should be buried
1046217	It's North from here
1046218	It's North-East from here
1046219	It's East from here
1046220	It's South-East from there
1046221	It's South from here
1046222	It's South-West from here
1046223	It's West from here
1046224	It's North-West from here
1046225	* the magic fails *
1046226	an enchanted sextant
1046227	I'm sorry but it seems your backpack is too full to accept your reward. Come back when you have room for it.
1046228	To show me a pickaxe you have made, drag the pickaxe onto me and I will review your crafted pickaxe.
1046229	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithing skill a couple of points.
1046230	You need to clear some space in your backpack to continue with the quest.  Visit Uzeraan when you have more space in your backpack.
1046231	The treasure should be here on this island somewhere. I've also given you an enchanted sextant that will help you find your way.
1046232	You're standing right on top of the spot!
1046233	Press ALT-R to bring up your overhead map.  Then you can double click the enchanted sextant to tell you the way.
1046234	Take heed though, the magic of the sextant will only work for you. Don't give it away!
1046235	Once you have found the spot, you will need to follow these steps to bring up the treasure:
1046236	1. Double click your shovel
1046237	2. Target the Treasure map
1046238	3. Target the spot on the ground where the treasure is buried
1046239	If you are digging in the right spot, the chest will emerge, and the treasure's guardians will emerge.
1046240	You must slay all of the guardians before you can open the treasure chest.  Return here after you have completed the treasure hunt.
1046241	You have done well against the guardians of the treasure!  I feel I can entrust you with yet another quest.
1046242	We once used one of the caves below the island for mining purposes.
1046243	Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046244	Good luck, young fighter! I hope you succeed!  May the aethers have mercy on us if you do not.
1046245	Gather your weapon, armor and I suggest at least 30 bandages before you return.
1046246	Come back here after you have made the necessary arrangements and I will teleport you - providing I find the blasted rune.
1046247	Slay his captors and free him!  May your road to glory be paved with the blood of our oppressors.  Go now.
1046248	Well done young fighter! Stay on the path of virtue and glory and honor will be yours.
1046249	I foresee that you will become a mighty warrior.  I see fortune and glory on your path!
1046250	Take this magical sword.  It is a mighty fine weapon.  It will serve you well in your conquest against evil.
1046251	Go forth and kill at least 6 of the 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find evidence of our missing men.
1046252	Find and dig up the treasure.  Slay the guardians and take the booty that is rightfully yours.
1046253	Quest Complete!  You have found the treasure and have slain the guardians. Return to Uzeraan.
1046254	You have excavated the treasure. Return to Uzeraan.
1046255	I've given you a bag with some black, night sight potions. Drink them to see in the dark.  I've also included a few heal potions.
1046256	I have placed some bandages and heal potions in your pack, compliments of the villagers.
1046257	Are you sure you want to release your pet? Pets summoned from Statues and Prisms will vanish permanently!
1046258	Your quest is complete.
1046259	Haven
1046260	You need to clear some space in your inventory to continue with the quest.  Come back here when you have more space in your inventory.
1046261	That's not enough my friend.  I need 75.  No less.
1046262	I can unfortunately not travel with you, but I have something that will help you find your way.
1046263	Take this enchanted sextant to help guide you on your journey back. Double click the sextant to show you the way to the nearest Moongate.
1046264	Once you find a Moongate, step into it and choose Moonglow as your destination.
1046265	The sextant refuses to be picked up by you
1046266	What misfortunes have befallen you that you would return without completing your task?
1046267	I have adjusted the magical teleporter to take you back.  Step onto the teleporter when you are ready.
1046268	Unfortunately, evil mages have relocated the prisoner to another camp.  Aegis has information on their whereabouts.
1046269	Seek out Aegis in Moonglow and see if he can transport you to the new location of his captured apprentice.
1046270	I have made the necessary adjustments to the Teleporter here. Step on to it when you are ready to depart.
1046271	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Shadow Wisp' in the cage near the water fountain.
1046272	However, be sure to not attack the monsters in the cage as they are currently under the protection of the town guards.
1046273	You can find out if a creature is attackable or not by the color of their name when you look at them (single click).
1046274	If the name is in blue, then you may not attack them without becoming a criminal.
1046275	Needless to say, becoming a criminal in town will most certainly be detrimental to your health.
1046276	The monsters that you will encounter outside of this mansion, however will highlight grey, which means you can freely attack them.
1046277	Now please go. Time is short, dear friend.
1046278	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Headless' in the cage near the water fountain
1046279	Please also note the blacksmith standing next to the magic teleporter. He sells armor and weapons.
1046280	It may be wise to purchase some equipment from him.  I would suggest armor made of ringmail and perhaps a shield.
1046281	Don't spend all your money on armor though, as you will no doubt at some time wish to purchase bolts of cloth for bandages.
1046282	Cloth can be purchased from tailors and can be cut up with scissors to create bandages.
1046283	Use bandages on yourself (double click bandages and target yourself) any time your hit points get too low.
1046284	Bandages are very cost-effective. Of course, you could also drink a healing potion (yellow) to heal your damage.
1046285	Potions, however, can be costly and require a free hand to drink.  Purchasing any of these items is easy.
1046286	Simply walk up to the appropriate vendor and say the words 'Vendor Buy', or use the vendor's context menu.
1046287	You have died.
1046288	As a ghost you cannot interact with the world. You cannot touch items nor can you use them.
1046289	You can pass through doors as though they do not exist.  However, you cannot pass through walls.
1046290	No one can understand what you say whilst you are dead, unless they are using the 'Spiritualism' skill to understand your words.
1046291	Since you are a new player, any items you had on your person at the time of your death will be in your backpack upon resurrection.
1046292	To be resurrected you must find a healer in town or wandering in the wilderness.  Some powerful players may also be able to resurrect you.
1046293	While you are still in young status, you will be transported to the nearest healer (along with your items) at the time of your death.
1046294	To rejoin the world of the living simply walk near one of the NPC healers, and they will resurrect you as long as you are not marked as a criminal.
1046295	Target the book you wish to copy.
1046296	That is not a book
1046297	You may not loot this mongbat. Find the one that took your gold.
1046298	This mongbat does not have your gold. You need to find the mongbat that highlights grey.
1046299	No one is allowed to enter this cave from here.
1046300	This yellow potion needs to be in your backpack before you may use it.
1046301	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>Um... er... greetings. I... um... had some gold that I was supposed to give you... gold courtesy of Uzeraan, who's a mage you'll meet later.</BASEFONT></BODY>
1046302	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>But, ya see, one of those mongbats over there took the gold from me just before you arrived. I think you'll be able to get the gold back from the creature. Don't worry, I can teach you some things you'll need to know.</BASEFONT></BODY>

1046356	If you are leaving the mansion, you should learn about the Radar Map.
1046357	The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.
1046358	Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little.  The map shows you your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.
1046359	You can close the map by right clicking on it.  Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
1046360	Why are you giving me this?  You need to make pickaxes!
1046361	You have not made two pickaxes.  Come back and show me your work when you have both completed.
1046362	Yes
1046363	No
1046364	Remember that context menus can be called up by single left clicking something (or shift-left click if you have changed the option).
1046365	After you have indicated to the vendor that you wish to purchase something, you will be shown a list of the goods they have to offer.
1046366	Speaking of context menus, you can bring up the status of your quest by bringing up your avatar's own context menu (single left, or shift-left click yourself).
1046367	Choose the 'Quest Log' option, and any information pertinent to your current quest status will be shown to you.
1046368	To help you find the location of the treasure, you should become familiar with the Radar Map.
1046369	The teleporter to the caves is against the north wall of this room.
1046370	May good luck and fortune guide your way.
1046371	Once you emerge from the Moongate, the city will be roughly to the north.  It should not be difficult to find.  Find Aegis and speak with him once you are in the city..
1046372	Actually, before you can spend this money, you will have to take the check to a bank and cash it.
1046373	NPC shop keepers do not accept checks as payment.  Checks are a handy way to transport large sums of money without having to lug all that gold around.
1046374	Cashing a check is very easy.  All you have to do is locate a NPC Banker or Minter, walk near them and say the word 'Bank'.
1046375	Place the check into your bank box and double click it to cash it.  Bankers and Minters can be found inside of banks across the world.
1046376	There is a bank not too far from here, Southeast of this shop, actually.  Banks are often crowded with people conducting business.
1046377	Go now to cash your check.  The person cashing your check will explain the details of Britannia's banking system to you.
1046378	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1046379	To open your bank box, you must be near a Banker or Minter and say the word 'Bank'.
1046380	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1046381	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place in to a bank box anywhere, can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1046382	That is to say, your bank box, along with any goods you placed into it,  is accessible from any bank in the land.
1046383	The safest place for any of your goods, is your bank box.  No one can access it except for you.
1046384	That's pretty much all there is to banking.  I bet you are eager to explore the world, so I won't hold you up any longer.
1046385	I've no tasks for you to complete, and you are free to adventure in the world on your own.
1046386	May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.  We shall no doubt see each other again.
1046387	Farewell.
1046388	Locate the bank and find the NPC Banker (or Minter) inside.  Then, say the word 'Bank' and place your check into your bank box and double click it.
1046389	To make it easier to find the Treasure, be sure to use your radar map.
1046390	To make your attack, you will most likely wish to use your magical powers, so allow me to give you a brief explanation of magic.
1046391	Most often, spells start out as scrolls written by either NPC or Player scribes.  Once a spell has been successfully scribed, you have two choices:
1046392	One: You can cast the spell by using (double click) the scroll.  No spell reagents (ingredients) are required to cast spells from scrolls. Casting from a scroll consumes the scroll.
1046393	Two: You can drop the scroll on to your spellbook where it will be permanently written.  You can then cast the spell from your spellbook any time you wish.
1046394	To cast a spell from a spellbook, the necessary reagents are required (listed with the spell in your spellbook).
1046395	Casting spells from a spellbook AND casting spells from scrolls requires a certain amount of mana. The actual amount of mana required differs from circle to circle.
1046396	The 1st circle of spells is the easiest of spells to cast (and also has the least mana requirement) whilst 8th circle spells are difficult even for a Grandmaster Mage.
1046397	To actually cast a spell from your spellbook, you must first open your spellbook (double click).  This opens the book to the 1st & 2nd circle spells.
1046398	You can turn pages by single clicking the corner in the top right hand side of the spellbook, or you can single click on the circled numbers on the bottom to jump to specific circle.
1046399	You can double click any of the spell names to make an attempt at casting that spell.  To see a spell's reagent requirements, single click on the spell name.
1046400	Single clicking on a spell name will give you all the details of the spell.  You can see the aforementioned reagent requirements as well as the spell's icon.
1046401	Another way of casting a spell is to click on that spell's spell icon.  You can drag any spell's icon off of the book and place it anywhere in the game window.
1046402	Once a spell icon is in the game window, it will stay there even if you close the spellbook.  This is an easy way to set up many spells for quick casting.
1046403	Before going into battle, you should always check your reagent supply and make sure you have your spell icons set up.
1046404	You now have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046405	You have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046406	I have drawn you a picture of what the Reagent Shop sign looks like (left).   Remember that you can also look at (single click) shop signs to read them.
1046407	Marking runes is easy.  I'll give you a quick explanation of how it works, then I would advise that you mark a rune somewhere around my mansion so you can return quickly.
1046408	To mark a rune, you must stand in the place where you wish to appear when casting the 'Recall' or 'Gate' spell.
1046409	Then you cast the mark spell (either from a scroll or your spellbook, as I have explained earlier).  Once the spell is cast you will get a targeting cursor.
1046410	Target the rune you wish to mark and single click it.  If your spell is successful, the rune will sparkle and will from then on be 'marked'.
1046411	Looking at the rune (single click) will give you the description of the rune.  If you wish to change the default description, simply double click the rune.
1046412	Once you have double clicked the rune, you will get a text prompt.  Enter the new description and press the [enter] key on your keyboard.
1046413	By naming all of your runes to something that is meaningful to you, you can keep your rune library organized and easy to use.
1046414	the remains of ~1_NAME~
1046415	~1_bulkname~ / ~2_amountreq~ ~3_intamount~ / ~4_excep~ / ~5_ingottype~ / ~6_itemname~
1046416	During combat it is important to keep an eye on your hit points.  Should they ever drop below 0, you will die.
1046417	To bring up your status bar, single click yourself and drag away from your avatar.  Double click the status bar to see details.
1046418	If your health drops too low, you should heal yourself with bandages or healing potions.  Heal yourself often, and you should have no trouble surviving.
1046419	One more thing before you depart for battle:
1046420	You have found a Moongate.  Remember to choose 'Moonglow' as your destination when you step into the gate.
1046421	Moonglow is where Aegis is waiting for you in his shop.
1046422	Congratulations! You've completed all of your quests!
1046423	I can open a Moongate for you from here to an area close to the Moongate that can take you to the city of Moonglow.
1046424	I only have runes marked for near the Moongate, but the sextant will help you find the rest of the way.
1046425	Aegis' Shop
1046426	I have drawn you a picture to the left of what the sign on Aegis' Shop looks like. It should help you find it a little easier.
1046427	You do not have enough reagents to safely go on.  You should acquire at least 35 of each reagent.
1046428	There are 8 types of reagent: Mandrake, Nightshade, Black Pearl, Sulfurous Ash, Spider's Silk, Garlic, Ginseng and Bloodmoss.
1046429	The caves tend to be dark, so be sure to cast the 'Night Sight' spell on yourself if you have trouble seeing.

1048049	I don't feel comfortable sending you into this battle with the amount of reagents you currently have on your person.
1048050	Please go and gather at least 35 of each reagent before returning.
1048051	Remember that there are 8 different reagents: Spider's Silk, Bloodmoss, Mandrake, Ginseng, Nightshade, Garlic, Black Pearl and Sulfurous Ash.
1048052	Double click the grey order deeds to open them.  Once open, the deed lists which items and what quantity the armourer needs.  Once you forge an item, combine the item with the deed by choosing ‘Combine Item’ and targeting the item.
1048053	You can't stable that!
1048054	Uzeraan explains the bank is on the north side of town.  Take your bank check to a banker and drop it on the banker to cash it in.
1048055	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1048056	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithing skill a couple points.  Now, I would like to let you take some time to put your goods in the bank. The bank is right next to the mansion to the southeast.
1048057	As you approach the bank, the names of bankers and their titles of 'banker' or 'minter' will appear.  This means you have located the building where you can access your bank account.
1048058	How to open your bank account by saying the word 'bank' and depositing items.  Once finished, visit Uzeraan and he will give you a pack horse.
1048059	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1048060	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1048061	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place into a bank box anywhere can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1048062	The safest place for any of your goods is your bank box.  No one can access your bank box except for you.
1048063	After you have finished depositing items in your bank, visit Uzeraan for a pack horse.
1048064	Uzeraan explains how to use a pack horse.  Take your pack horse to mountains south of Uzeraan's castle.
1048065	Pack horses are used to carry large quantities of items that you normally could not fit in your backpack.  Miners use them for carrying large quantities of ore, ingots, and some tools.
1048066	Pack horses are loyal to their masters unless they are not fed.  Apples or pears are foods that the pack horses appreciate and will keep them loyal.
1048067	Once you have renamed your pack horse, you can have your pet obey commands.  The most common commands are 'follow me' and 'stay'.  However, your pet must be in range to hear you.
1048068	All pets you own can be renamed.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the pack horse and drag its health bar.
1048069	Try walking away from your pack horse and tell it to follow you by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'follow'.
1048070	To get your pet to stay, you would tell it to stay by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'stay' from the command list.
1048071	Mine 40 piles of ore from the mountains and use your pack horse to haul the piles of ore.  Visit Uzeraan at his mansion once you have the 40 piles of ore.
1048072	Now that you know how to handle your pack horse, use your new pack horse to haul 40 large piles of ore from the mountains.  You will need to tinker a couple more shovels to be able to mine the ore.
1048073	You can double-click on your pack horse to open its backpack.  While open, you can load your pack horse by dropping items into its backpack.
1048074	Uzeraan encourages you to practice to 70 skill in blacksmithing.  You do not have to train immediately.  When you have reached 70 skill, visit Uzeraan.
1048075	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  You have mastered the basics of mining and blacksmithing.  I am giving you 500 gold for your ore.  You may keep your pack horse.
1048076	Now that you have accomplished so much, you should train your blacksmithing skill so you may perform a more difficult task.  It may take some time to train to 70 skill.  I have a task to ask of you when you have finished training.
1048077	You do not need to hurry out and train.  The world is waiting to be explored and some adventurers may need your skills.  Come visit me when you have trained to 70 skill (or higher).
1048078	Now that you are an accomplished blacksmith, Uzeraan has another set of orders the armourers of Minoc would like you to fulfill.  Once completed, give them to an armourer or blacksmith in the city of Minoc.
1048079	Uzeraan says: Ah, I see that you are well on your way to mastering blacksmithing.  I have four order deeds that the armourers would like you to fulfill in Minoc.
1048080	One of the deeds is the large order, which must be combined to completed order deeds.  The three smaller deeds are for chainmail.
1048081	Combine the items requested in the order with the small deed.  Once the deed is completed, you can use the large order deed to combine with a smaller deed.
1048082	The large order deed, when it is filled with all of the small deeds, would then be dropped onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.  They will make sure your goods go to those in need.
1048083	Visit Uzeraan once you have completed the orders for the armourers of Minoc.
1048084	Mastering blacksmithing
1048085	Now that you have helped the blacksmiths of Minoc, you have proved your worthiness of mastering blacksmithing.
1048086	When you have reached 100 skill in blacksmithing, you will have the ability to mark your crafted items with your name.
1048087	Folk from around the world of Britannia can wear your signed armor and wield your signature weapons when you are a grandmaster blacksmith.
1048088	You have just slain your first 'Headless'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself, if need be.
1048089	To check your health, single left-click + drag away from your avatar. This brings up your status bar.
1048090	Double click the status bar to see detailed information. Check your hitpoints and determine if you would like to heal yourself at this point or not.
1048091	To heal yourself you may use bandages (double click bandages and target yourself) or drink a heal potion (free one of your hands and double click the potion).
1048092	Alternatively, if you know your way around spellbooks and such, you can cast the Heal or Greater Heal spells to recover lost hitpoints.
1048093	You have slain the leader of the pack.
1048094	Be sure to check his corpse (double click) for the red box which holds the key to the cage in which the apprentice is being held.
1048095	Cast the Unlock spell on the red box to open the lock.
1048096	Open (double click) the red box and find the key inside. Take the key (drag and drop into your pack).
1048097	Use the key (double click) and target the door on the prison cage. This will unlock the door.
1048098	Now you can open the door (double click) to free the apprentice.
1048099	You have just slain your first 'Shadow Wisp'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself if need be.
1048100	A Time For Healing
1048101	The Leader Lies Dead
1048102	You should have a bank check in your backpack (a yellow check).  Speak the word 'bank' to open your bank box, drag your bank check into the box, and double-click it to cash it in.
1048103	Visit Uzeraan after you have loaded 40 large piles of ore onto your pack horse.
1048104	To feed your pack horse, you would drag one apple or pear onto your pack horse.  A good practice is to feed your pack horse once an hour.
1048105	Click on the name on the health bar, delete its current name and type in a new name like 'Ed' or 'Trigger' (without spaces in the name).
1048106	The pack horse should whinny and walk towards you (unless it is not well fed), after you target yourself with the target cursor.
1048107	If the list has not ever displayed, try holding the shift key and left-clicking on the pack horse.  Take your pack horse south to the mountains to receive further instructions.

1049321	Find the High Mage <I>Schmendrick</I> in the mines and recover the scroll of power from him.
1049322	<I>Schmendrick barely pays you any attention as you approach him.  His mind seems to be occupied with something else.  You explain to him that you came for the scroll of power and after a long while he begins to speak, but apparently still not giving you his full attention...</I><BR><BR>Hmmm.. peculiar indeed.  Very strange activity here indeed... I wonder...<BR><BR>Hmmm.  Oh yes! Scroll, you say?  I don't have it, sorry. My apprentice was carrying it, and he ran off to somewhere in this cave.  Find him and you will find the scroll.<BR><BR>Be sure to bring the scroll to Uzeraan once you have it. He's the only person aside from myself who can read the ancient markings on the scroll.  I need to figure out what's going on down here before I can leave.  Strange activity indeed...<BR><BR><I>Schmendrick goes back to his work and you seem to completely fade from his awareness...
1049323	Find Schmendrick's apprentice who is somewhere in the mining cave.  The apprentice has the scroll of power needed by Uzeraan.
1049324	You have obtained the scroll of power!  Find your way out of the cave.<BR><BR>Hand the scroll to Uzeraan (drag and drop) once you arrive in his mansion.
1049325	<I>Uzeraan carefully unravels the scroll and begins to read...after a short while his face lights up with a smile and he speaks to you...</I><BR><BR>This is wonderful, friend!  For your troubles I've given you a treasure map I had laying about, along with a shovel to <a href = "?ForceTopic91">dig up the treasure</a>.  Feel free to find the treasure at your leisure.<BR><BR>Now let us get back to the business of this scroll. The only trouble, is that this scroll calls for some special ingredients that I do not have on hand.<BR><BR>Though it may involve some danger, I will ask of you to find these reagents for me.  <BR><BR>There are three reagents I need to complete the spell.<BR><BR>The first thing I need is some <I>Fertile Dirt</I>.<BR><BR>There lives a Dryad on this island who I know would have such a thing on hand.  I have recalibrated the teleporter to transport you to the Dryad's grove, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of this mansion.<BR><BR>Tell her Uzeraan sent you, and she should cooperate.<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry.  I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>.  Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this mansion.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me or any of my mansion guards the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.
1049326	<I>The Dryad watches hungrily as you approach, giving you an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You explain that Uzeraan has sent you for a quantity of fertile dirt.  With a wide grin and in a slightly hoarse voice she replies...</I><BR><BR><I>Fertile Dirt</I>, eh?  Well, I have a few patches here...but what have you brought me in return?  Came empty-handed did you?  That's unfortunate indeed... but since you were sent by my dear friend Uzeraan, I supposed I could oblige you.<BR><BR><I>The Dryad digs around in the ground and hands you a patch of Fertile Dirt.<BR><BR>With a smile she goes back to her work...</I>
1049327	You have acquired the <I>Fertile Dirt</I>!<BR><BR>Return to the mansion (<a href = "?ForceTopic13">North-East</a> of the Dryad's Grove) and hand it to Uzeraan.
1049328	NullString.
1049329	<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some bandages as well as some healing potions.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!
1049330	You have been ambushed! Fight for your honor!!!
1049331	You take a vial of blood from the chest and put it in your pack.
1049332	You have the vial of blood!<BR><BR>Return to Uzeraan's mansion and hand him the vial.
1049333	<I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take this magical silver sword to aid you in your battle.  Silver weapons will damage the undead twice as much as your regular weapon.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.
1049334	Head <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of here (or use the Horn of Retreat) to return to Uzeraan's Mansion and deliver the bone to Uzeraan.
1049335	<I>As you hand Uzeraan the final reagent, he nods at you with approval and starts searching through the pockets of his robe...<BR><BR>After a short while he hands you a small pouch...</I><BR><BR>There you are.  Your contract of employment with me has expired and so here is your pay.  2000 gold in the form of a check and a magical sextant that will help you find <a href = "?ForceTopic47">Moongates</a> and Banks.<BR><BR>Before you can actually spend the money I have given you, however, you must <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a>.<BR><BR>I have recalibrated the teleporter to take you to the Haven <a href="?ForceTopic38">Bank</a>.  Step onto the teleporter to be taken to the bank, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of here.<BR><BR>Thank you for all your help friend.  I hope we shall meet each other again in the future.<BR><BR>Farewell.
1049336	Locate the Haven Bank (use the teleporter in Uzeraan's Mansion if necessary), which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of Uzeraan's Mansion.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1049337	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer!  I see you've learned how to cash checks.  Wonderful!  Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land.  For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Haven, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Britain or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure.  So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself.  Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia!  We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow!  May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1049338	You find a vial of blood, but can't pick it up because your pack is too full.  Come back when you have more room in your pack.
1049339	Your pack is too full to carry the sword that Uzeraan wishes to give you.  Talk to Uzeraan again when you have enough room in your pack and he will give you the sword at that time.
1049340	Uzeraan hands you a finely crafted sword which you immediately place into your backpack.
1049341	You rummage through the bones and find a Daemon Bone!  You quickly place the item in your pack.
1049342	Rummaging through the bones you find a Daemon Bone, but can't pick it up because your pack is too full.  Come back when you have more room in your pack.
1049343	You can only drop quest items into the top-most level of your backpack while you still need them for your quest.
1049344	You decide against trading the item.  You still need it for your quest.
1049345	You've lost the scroll?  Argh!  I will have to try and re-construct the scroll from memory.  Bring me a blank scroll, which you can <a href = "?ForceTopic33">purchase from the mage shop</a> just <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of Uzeraan's mansion in Haven.<BR><BR>Return the scroll to me and I will try to make another scroll for you.<BR><BR>When you return, be sure to hand me the scroll (drag and drop).
1049346	Schmendrick scribbles on the scroll for a few moments and hands you the finished product.
1049347	You've <I>lost</i> the vial blood?  Oh my...  Please go back to the chest and fetch another one.  It's important that we have all of the ingredients.
1049348	All items must be made with deep sea leather.
1049349	All items must be made with lizard leather.
1049350	All items must be made with serpent leather.

1049357	I have nothing more for you at this time.
1049358	Find the Dryad in the woods of Haven and get a patch of fertile dirt from her.<BR><BR>Use Uzeraan's teleporter to get there if necessary.
1049359	You've lost the dirt I gave you?<BR><BR>My, my, my... What ever shall we do now?<BR><BR>I can try to make you some more, but I will need something that I can transform.  Bring me an <I>apple</I>, and I shall see what I can do.<BR><BR>You can <a href = "?ForceTopic33">buy</a> apples from the Provisioner's Shop, which is located a ways <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of Uzeraan's mansion.<BR><BR>Hand me the apple when you have it, and I shall see about transforming it for you.<BR><BR>Good luck.<BR><BR>
1049360	<I>The Dryad sticks the apple into the ground and you watch it rot before your eyes.<BR><BR>She pulls the now fertile dirt out of the ground and hands it to you.</I><BR><BR>There you go friend.  Try not to lose it again this time, eh?
1049361	Bring back a vial of blood.<BR><BR>Follow the road leading north from the mansion and walk into the hut to find the chest that contains the vial
1049362	Use Uzeraan's teleporter to get to the Haunted graveyard.<BR><BR>Slay the undead until you find a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.

1049370	You must wait a while before offering your protection again.
1049371	The protective relationship between ~1_PLAYER1~ and ~2_PLAYER2~ has been ended.
1049372	You cannot use this ability here.
1049373	You have lost some Justice.
1049374	You return without <I>Fertile Dirt</I>?  It is imperative that we get all of the ingredients friend.<BR><BR>Seek out the Dryad and ask her to help you again.
1049375	You return without <I>a Vial of Blood</I>?  It is imperative that we get all of the ingredients friend.<BR><BR>Go back to the chest and fetch another vial.  Please hurry.
1049376	You return without <I>a Daemon Bone</I>?  It is imperative that we get all of the ingredients friend.<BR><BR>Go back to the graveyard and continue hunting the undead until you find another one.  Please hurry.
1049377	You return without the scroll???<BR><BR>All hope is lost without it, friend.  Return to the mines and talk to Schmendrick to see if he can help us out of this predicament.
1049378	Hand me the scroll, if you have it.
1049379	Hand me the Vial of Blood, if you have it.
1049380	Hand me the Daemon Bone, if you have it.
1049381	Hand me the Fertile Dirt, if you have it.
1049382	a magical teleporter
1049383	The teleporter doesn't seem to work for you.
1049384	I have recharged the item for you.
1049385	That doesn't need recharging yet.
1049386	<I>Uzeraan greets you as you approach...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>I am Uzeraan, the lord of this house and overseer of this fine city, Haven.  I know we have just met, but time is short and we need to reinforce the troops in the mountain pass, so I will not waste your time with pleasantries.<BR><BR>We have been trying to fight back the wicked <I>Horde Minions</I> which have recently begun attacking our cities - but to no avail.  We desperately need help!<BR><BR>Your first task will be to assess the situation in the mountain pass, and help our troops defeat the Horde Minions there.<BR><BR>Take the road marked with glowing runes, that starts just outside of this mansion. Before you go into battle, it would be prudent to <a href="?ForceTopic35">review your magic skills</a> as well as <a href = "?ForceTopic29">information on healing yourself</a>.<BR><BR>To aid you in your fight, you may also wish to <a href = "?ForceTopic33">purchase equipment</a> from Frank the Blacksmith, who is standing just <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South</a> of here.<BR><BR>Good luck young mage.
1049387	<I>You give your report to Uzeraan and after a while, he begins to speak...</I><BR><BR>Your report is grim,  but all hope is not lost!  It has become apparent that our swords and spells will not drive the evil from Haven.<BR><BR>The head of my order, the High Mage Schmendrick, arrived here shortly after you went into battle with the <I>Horde Minions</I>.  He has brought with him a scroll of great power, that should aid us greatly in our battle.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, the entrance to one of our mining caves collapsed recently, trapping our miners inside.<BR><BR>Schmendrick went to install magical teleporters inside the mines so that the miners would have a way out.  The miners have since returned, but Schmendrick has not. Those who have returned, all seem to have lost their minds to madness
1049388	<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some <a href = "?ForceTopic37">reagents</a> as well as some <a href="?ForceTopic35">spell scrolls</a>.

1049429	Some magical items use <I>charges</I> to exercise their magical properties.  In most cases, a single use of the item will consume one (1) charge.<BR><BR>Once a magical item is out of charges, it will usually cease to operate unless you can find a way of recharging it.
1049430	Bank Checks
1049431	Checks are an easy and safe way to transport large sums of cash about without having to carry all that heavy gold on your person.  As an additional bonus, bank checks are <a href = "?84">"blessed"</a>.  As a drawback, checks cannot be directly spent on goods that you purchase from <a href = "?33">Shopkeepers</a> or <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.  To spend money from a check, you must first cash it.<BR><BR><U>Cashing a check</U><BR><BR>To cash a bank check, you must first find any bank (locations available in every major city), and <a href = "?38">open your bank box</a>.  Once your bank box is open, drag and drop the check into the bank box.  Once the check is inside of your bank box, simply double click the check to cash it.  The cash will be automatically deposited into your bank box.
1049432	Blessed Items
1049433	Most blessed items can normally be identified by the "[blessed]" tag that displays above the item when looking at (single clicking) it. A blessed item cannot be stolen and will stay with your avatar, even through death. The blessed item will be located in your backpack upon resurrection.
1049434	Cursed Items
1049435	Cursed items are the opposite of <a href ="?84">blessed</a> items.  Cursed items can be identified by the "[cursed]" tag it displays when looking at (single clicking) it.<BR><BR>Cursed items will <I>always</I> drop to your corpse when you die.  While on the Felucca facet, cursed items can always be stolen.<BR><BR>As a final point, cursed items can never be blessed.
1049436	That player cannot be protected.
1049437	Scrolls of Power
1049438	These scrolls, when used,  will allow you to permanently raise the maximum skill value, in a given skill, beyond 100.0 (up to 120.0). They can be found for various skills and will give varied skill max bonuses (+5, +10, +15, +20).   The scrolls can only be found as loot on special <I>Champion</I> creatures, which can be found in dungeons, and the <I>2nd Age</I> adventuring areas.<BR><BR><U>Important Information:</U><BR><BR>Scrolls of Power are <a href="?87">cursed</a>, so be careful when transporting them.
1049439	Player Protection
1049440	A player who has attained at least Level One (1) in the Justice Virtue may chose to "protect" another player.  This protection can take the form of anything the protector and the protectee agree upon.  Either party may chose to cancel the agreement at any time, via a <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the protectee.  Each player may only be protected by one (1) player, although a protector can protect as many persons as they chose.<BR><BR><U>How does the protector benefit from this?</U><BR><BR>When a protectee acquires a <a href = "?89">Scroll of Power</a>, the protector will automatically also receive a Scroll of Power.  The protector must be in the area to receive the scroll.
1049441	Context Menus
1049442	Context Menus are menus that are available by single left-clicking (or Shift + single left-click, see below) on most objects or NPCs in the world.  Nearly everything, including your own avatar will have context menus available.<BR><BR>If an object in the world has a context menu available, it will by default appear when you single-left click something.  You may change this in under "Options" (located on your <a href = "?2">paperdoll</a>) to work only when you are holding down the "Shift" button on your keyboard.

1049549	Youthful Treasuremaps
1049550	Treasure maps are pieces of paper that will show the location of a buried treasure somewhere in the land.<BR><BR>To find this treasure, a few simple steps must be followed.<BR><BR><U>1.</U> Use the <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map to decode the map. Once a map is decoded, it will no longer have the word "tattered" in it's title.  This is a handy thing to know if you want to find out if a map has been previously decoded or not.  This is important, since only the person that decoded the map, can actually dig up the treasure.<BR><BR><U>2.</U> Finding the treasure is a rather simple procedure on youthful treasuremaps.  You will need some sort of digging device (like a shovel or a pickaxe) to unearth the treasure.  Once you have secured your tools, you will need to open the map (double click) and take a look at it.  Use your <a href = "?14">Radar Map</a> to see if you can somewhat figure out where the treasure might be by comparing the drawing on the map and the picture from the the overhead Radar.<BR><BR>If you are having trouble making out the area,  the best thing to do is to find a patch of grass or dirt (out in the woods perhaps), and start digging.  Digging is easily accomplished by using the "Dig for Treasure" <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map.<BR><BR>Once you select the digging option, target the place on the ground that you wish to dig at.  If you are not at the correct spot, you will get help message telling you which direction to move in.  Follow the directions and keep digging until you find the chest.<BR><BR><U>3.</U> Once the chest has emerged, the treasure's guardians will appear.  You must defeat all of the treasure's guardians before you can loot the chest.<BR><BR>Good luck.
1049551	The Nightsight Spell
1049552	The Nightsight Spell is a 1st circle spell, and can be cast by nearly everyone.  The effect of the spell is such, that the person who is targeted by the spell will be able to see in the dark.  This spell is especially useful in dungeons and dark woods.<BR><BR>The two <a href = "?37">reagents</a>  that are required for this spell, are Spider's Silk and Sulfurous Ash.
1049553	Travel Spells
1049554	There are three (3) magic spells that can be used to transport yourself and your friends to anywhere in the world - instantaneously.<BR><BR><U><a href = "?94">The Mark Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This spell is the basis for the other travels spells. It allows you mark a location that you wish to return to at a later time, using one of the other two travel spells. <a href = "?94">more...</a><BR><BR><U><a href = "?95">The Recall Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This is the easiest of the two transport spells to cast.  It allows one traveler (the person casting) to teleport to a previously <a href="?94">marked</a> location. <a href = "?95">more...</a><BR><BR><U><a href = "?96">The Gate Spell</a></u><BR><BR>This spell allows the caster to open a magical gate that allows anyone that steps into it to travel to a previously <a href="?94">marked</a> location. <a href = "?96">more...</a>.
1049555	The Mark Spell
1049556	The Mark Spell is a sixth (6th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any rune (which can be <a href = "?33">purchased</a> from most magic shops) to <i>mark</i> that rune with your current location.  If the spell is successful, the rune will be permanently marked.  You can mark over an already marked rune, which replaces your new location with the old location.<BR><BR>Once a rune is marked, you can use either the <a href = "?94">Recall</a> or the <a href = "?96">Gate</a> spell to travel back to the marked location, instantaneously.
1049557	The Recall Spell
1049558	The Recall Spell is a fourth (4th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to instantly teleport to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and you will be transported.  Keep in mind that this spell only transports the caster - any pets (unless they are bonded) or friends that are with you, will be left behind.
1049559	The Gate Spell
1049560	The Gate Spell is a seventh (7th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Sullfurous Ash</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to open a magical gate to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and a temporary gate will open.  The gate will remain open only for a few moments before it closes again.  Anyone wishing to travel through the gate, need only to walk into the gate and they will be transported. <BR><BR>As long as your pets are following you, they too will be transported when they walk into a gate.

1049586	Refreshing Houses
1049587	To keep a house from collapsing, it must be periodically refreshed.  The actual refresh process is different, depending on the refresh type of the house.  Here is a list of all the different refresh types along with information on how a house enters the given refresh state.<BR><BR><U>Condemned</U><BR><BR>A house will be condemned when the house owner either places or accepts the transfer of a new home, or if the owner's player account becomes inactive.  Condemnation will affect all houses on all shards (except in the case of a transfer or newly placed house, in which case the last house that was acquired will not be condemned, but rather will enter into the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state. See below for details.).<BR><BR>Although the contents of a condemned house are still accessible as they normally would, the house cannot be refreshed.  In addition to not being refreshable, the house will collapse within 2 days of being condemned.  If a house entered the <I>condemned</I> status because the house owner's account became inactive, the house(s) may be uncondemned by the house owner, by openeing the front door.  Otherwise, the house can only be uncondemned by transferring or re-deeding it.<BR><BR><U>Grandfathered</U><BR><BR>These houses will be need to be manually refreshed by the house owner, one of the co-owners or house friends.  Refreshing is done by simply opening the front door.<BR><BR><U>Automatic</U><BR><BR>When an account has only one house across all shards, that house enters the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state.  These houses will never decay, unless they enter the <I>Condemned</I> state for any reason.  These houses will never have to be manually refreshed.

On top of this, some individual followers may count as more than one follower.  For example, a dragon counts as three followers, a hireling counts as two, and a horse counts as one.  This means you could have a dragon and two horses, or two mercenaries and one horse, or any combination thereof.<br><br>Note: Some powerful creatures, such as dragons, also require Taming and Druidism to control, regardless of the number of followers you have.

1050000	The locks on the door click loudly and you begin to hear a faint hissing near the walls.
1050001	It is becoming more difficult for you to breathe as the poisons in the room become more concentrated.
1050002	You have trouble breathing...
1050003	You begin to panic as the poison clouds thicken.
1050004	The circle is the key, the key is incomplete and so the gate remains closed.
1050005	The weight of the boulder pins you to the ground!
1050006	A flying rock smashes against your head!

1050012	Only the dead may cross!
1050013	You have summoned me in vain ~1_NAME~!  Only the dead may cross!
1050014	Why have you disturbed me, mortal?!?
1050015	Feel the wrath of my legions!!!
1050016	Very well mortal, I shall grant thee passage.
1050017	The ferryman has recently been summoned already.  You decide against ringing the bell again so soon.

1050019	Number of bones collected:
1050020	<I>Victoria turns to you and smiles...</I><BR><BR>Chyloth, eh?  He is the ferry man of lake <I>Mortis</I>, beyond which lies the nest of the <I>The Dark Father</I> - the fountainhead of all the evil that you see around you here.<BR><BR>800 and some years ago, my sisters and I persuaded the ferry man Chyloth to take us across the lake to battle the <I>The Dark Father</I>.  My party was utterly destroyed, except for me.  For my insolence, I was cursed by the <I>The Dark Father</I> to wander these halls for eternity, unable to die - unable to leave.<BR><BR>Chyloth usually only crosses over the souls of the undead, but he can be persuaded otherwise...with a token of gold, in the form of a human skull.  Such a gem can be found only in the belly of the hellspawn known as <I>the devourer</I>.<BR><BR>I can help you summon the beast from the depths of the abyss, but I require 1000 Daemon bones to do so.  If you accept my help, I will store the Daemon bones for you until you have collected all 1000 of them.  Once the bones are collected in full, I will summon the beast for you, which you must slay to claim your prize.<BR><BR>Do you accept?
1050021	Well done brave soul.   I shall summon the beast to the circle of stones just South-East of here.  Take great care - the beast takes many forms.  Now hurry...
1050022	For your valor in combating the devourer, you have been awarded a golden skull.
1050023	You find a golden skull, but your backpack is too full to carry it.
1050024	You pick up the golden skull and quickly place it in your backpack.  Hand the skull to Chyloth the ferry man, and he will cross you over lake Mortis.
1050025	The Summoning
1050026	Find 1000 Daemon bones and hand them to Victoria as you find them.
1050027	You have accepted Victoria's help.  She requires 1000 Daemon bones to summon the devourer.<BR><BR>You may hand Victoria the bones as you collect them and she will keep count of how many you have brought her.<BR><BR>Daemon bones can be collected via various means throughout Dungeon Doom.<BR><BR>Once you have given Victoria 1000 Daemon bones, she will not return them to you if you log out or leave the dungeon.<BR>Good luck.<BR>
1050028	Victoria has accepted the Daemon bones, but the requirement is not yet met.
1050029	<I>Victoria smiles weakly at you, and begins to speak...</I><BR><BR>Well done adventurer.  You have collected all the Daemon bones necessary for me to summon <I>the devourer</I>.  I will summon him to the circle just South-East of here.  If you manage to fell the beast, you reward will be the golden skull token that you seek.<BR><BR>May luck be on your side - you shall need it.
1050030	The Daemon bones that you have thus far given to Victoria have been returned to you.
1050031	I summon forth the forces of evil from the depth of the abyss!
1050032	I COMMAND thee to appear!
1050033	The devourer lies dead, unfortunately so do you.  You cannot claim your reward while dead.  You will need to face him again.
1050034	The devourer lies dead.  Unfortunately you did not sufficiently prove your worth in combating the devourer.  Victoria shall summon another incarnation of the devourer to the circle of stones.  Try again noble adventurer.
1050035	The devourer lies dead.  Search his corpse to claim your prize!
1050036	The devourer has been summoned near the circle of stones just South-East of here.  Help slay him for your prize!
1050037	Go forth and vanquish the devourer that has been summoned!
1050038	You have already given me all the Daemon bones necessary to weave the spell.  Keep these for a later time.

1054041	Study of the Solen Hive
1054042	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes, regarding you with a hopeful look in his eyes.</I><BR><BR>Um..yes..excuse me. I was wondering if you could offer me a bit of assistance. You see, I'm a naturalist of some repute - a gentleman and a scholar if you will - primarily interested in the study of insects and arachnids. While I've written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it? Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously protected by the Solen workers. If you would be so kind as to assist me, I would ask that you travel into the Solen Hive and inspect each of the Solen Egg Nests that reside within. You will have to spend some time examining each Nest before you have gathered enough information. Once you are done, report back to me and I will reward you as best as I can for your valiant efforts!<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054043	Ah! This is splendid news! Each time an assistant travels into the Solen Hive to gather information for me, I feel as if I am one step closer to some grand discovery. Though I felt the same way when I was certain that Terathans had the ability to change their shape to resemble various fruits and vegetables - a point on which I am certain further study of the beasts will prove correct.<BR><BR>In any case, I cannot thank you enough! Please return to me when you have studied all the Solen Egg Nests hidden within the Solen Hive.
1054044	Find an entrance to the Solen Hive, and search within for the Solen Egg Nests. Each Nest must be studied for some time without a break in concentration in order to gather useful information.<BR><BR>Once you have completed your study of the Nests, return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054045	You begin studying the Solen Egg Nest to gather information.
1054046	You abandon your study of the Solen Egg Nest without gathering the needed information.
1054047	You glance at the Egg Nest, realizing you've already studied this one.
1054048	You have studied enough Solen Egg Nests to gather a fair amount of useful information. Return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054049	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a frustrated look on his face.</I><BR><BR>Haven't you finished the task I appointed you yet? Gah! It's so difficult to find a good apprentice these days.<BR><BR>Remember, you must first find an entrance to the Solen Hive. Once inside, I need you to examine the Solen Egg Nests for me. When you have studied all four nests, you should have enough information to earn yourself a reward.<BR><BR>Now go on, away with you! I have piles of notes from other more helpful apprentices that I still need to study!
1054050	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a pleased expression on his face.</I><BR><BR>Ah! Thank you, my goodly apprentice! These notes you have gathered will no doubt assist me in my understanding of these fascinating Solen creatures.<BR><BR>Now, since you've done such a fine job, I feel that I should give you a little reward.<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>As a reward for your fine efforts, I present you with this strange rare seed. Which reminds me, I still need to compile my notes on Solen dietary habits. They are voracious seed eaters, those Solen Matriarchs!<BR><BR>In any case, I must get back to my notes now. I give you my thanks once more, and bid a good day to you my little apprentice! If you wish to help me out again, just say the word.
1054051	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with an ecstatic look upon his face.</I><BR><BR>Oh my! These notes you've brought me - they say you have information on the Secret Solen Egg Nest? I've heard many tales of this secret store of special Solen Eggs, but there are many missing gaps in my notes concerning it.<BR><BR>The notes you've made here will most certainly advance my understanding of this mysterious breed of creatures!<BR><BR>Considering the amazing effort you put into your work, I feel as if I should give you something extra special as a bonus. Hrmm...<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce rare mutant strains of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>I've given a few of her seeds out to various apprentices - but I usually keep her very rare stock all for myself: the black, white and fire red seeds. They're quite amazing looking! However, since you've done such a fine job for me, I'll present you with one of these rare seeds.<BR><BR>Once again, my thanks to you! Now I really must get back to studying these notes! Take care, my fine apprentice, and come back if you wish to help me further!
1054052	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his scribbled notes.</I><BR><BR>Greetings!<BR><BR>If you're interested in helping out a scholar of some repute, I do have some work that I could use some assistance with.<BR><BR>You seem a little preoccupied with another task right now, however. Perhaps you should finish whatever it is that has your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054053	<I>The Naturalist looks at you with a friendly expression.</I><BR><BR>I see you've returned with information for me. While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment. Perhaps you'd better free up some room before we get to discussing your reward.
1054054	You have completed your study of this Solen Egg Nest. You put your notes away.
1054055	Solen Nests Studied :
1054056	You notice something very odd about this Solen Egg Nest. You begin taking notes.
1054057	You complete your examination of this bizarre Egg Nest. The Naturalist will undoubtedly be quite interested in these notes!
1054058	You begin recording your completed notes on a bit of parchment.
1054059	<I>The Solen queen considers you for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Hmmm... I could perhaps benefit from your assistance, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Return to me when you complete whatever it is that you're working on and maybe I can still put you to good use.
1054060	<I>The Solen queen considers you eagerly for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes, I think you could be of use. Normally, of course, I would handle these things on my own, but these are busy times. Much to do, much to do. And besides, if I am to one day become the Matriarch, then it will be good to have experience trusting others to carry out various tasks for me. Yes.<BR><BR>That is my plan, you see - I will become the next Matriarch. Our current Matriarch is fine and all, but she won't be around forever. And when she steps down, I intend to be the next in line. Ruling others is my destiny, you see.<BR><BR>What I ask of you is quite simple. First, I need you to remove some of the - well - competition, I suppose. Though I dare say most are hardly competent to live up to such a title. I'm referring to the other queens of this colony, of course. My dear sisters, so to speak. If you could remove 5 of them, I would be most pleased. *sighs* By remove, I mean kill them. Don't make that face at me - this is how things work in a proper society, and ours has been more proper than most since the dawn of time. It's them or me, and whenever I give it any thought, I'm quite sure I'd prefer it to be them.<BR><BR>I also need you to gather some zoogi fungus for me - 50 should do the trick.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054061	<I>The Solen queen smiles as you decide to help her.</I><BR><BR>Excellent. We'll worry about the zoogi fungus later - start by eliminating 5 queens from my colony.<BR><BR>That part's important, by the way
1054062	Kill 5 red solen queens.
1054063	Kill 5 black solen queens.
1054064	Red Solen Queens killed:
1054065	Black Solen Queens killed:
1054066	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 5 queens from my colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Remember, by the way, that queens from the other solen colony and infiltrator queens do not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054067	You've completed your task of slaying solen queens. Return to the ambitious queen who asked for your help.
1054068	<I>The Solen queen looks pleased to see you.</I><BR><BR>Splendid! You've done quite well in reducing my competition to become the next Matriarch. Now I must ask that you gather some zoogi fungus for me. I must practice processing it into powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I believe the amount we agreed upon earlier was 50. Please return when you have that amount and then give them to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.
1054069	Gather zoogi fungus until you have 50 of them, then give them to the ambitious queen you are helping.
1054070	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Do you have the zoogi fungus?<BR><BR>If so, give them to me. Otherwise, go gather some and then return to me.
1054071	I have not asked you to bring me any zoogi fungus, therefore I cannot accept these.
1054072	Our arrangement was for 50 of the zoogi fungus. Please return to me when you have that amount.
1054073	<I>The Solen queen smiles as she takes the zoogi fungus from you.</I><BR><BR>Wonderful! I greatly appreciate your help with these tasks. My plans are beginning to take shape ensuring that I will be the next Matriarch. But there is still much to be done until then.<BR><BR>You've done what I've asked of you and for that I thank you. Please accept this bag of sending and some powder of translocation as a reward. Oh, and I suppose I should give you some gold as well. Yes, yes. Of course.
1054074	You have been given a bag of sending.
1054075	You have been given some powder of translocation.
1054076	You have been given some gold.
1054077	<I>The Solen queen looks at you with a smile.</I><BR><BR>While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps you should free some room in your backpack before we proceed.
1054078	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Ah good, you've returned. I will conclude our business by giving you any remaining rewards I owe you for aiding me.
1054079	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>Thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious.  <BR><BR>I would offer to make you a friend of my colony, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054080	Thank you for that plant seed. Those have such wonderful flavor.
1054081	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>It is good to see you again. I would offer to process some zoogi fungus for you, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054082	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>I thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious. So full of flavor.<BR><BR>Hmm... if you would like, I could make you a friend of my colony. This would stop the warriors, workers, and queens of my colony from thinking you are an intruder, thus they would not attack you. In addition, as a friend of my colony I will process zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you.<BR><BR>To become a friend of my colony, I ask that you complete a couple tasks for me. These are the same tasks I will ask of you when you wish me to process zoogi fungus, by the way.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054083	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>Hello again. It is always good to see a friend of our colony.<BR><BR>Would you like me to process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you? I would be happy to do so if you will first undertake a couple tasks for me.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054084	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks pleased that you've accepted.</I><BR><BR>Very good. Please start by hunting some infiltrators from the other solen colony and eliminating them. Slay 7 of them and then return to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now and good hunting.
1054085	Kill 7 red solen infiltrators.
1054086	Kill 7 black solen infiltrators.
1054087	Red Solen Infiltrators killed:
1054088	Black Solen Infiltrators killed:
1054089	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 7 infiltrators from the enemy colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054090	You've completed your task of slaying solen infiltrators. Return to the Matriarch who gave you this task.
1054091	<I>The Solen Matriarch nods favorably as you approach her.</I><BR><BR>Marvelous! I'm impressed at your ability to hunt and kill enemies for me. My colony is thankful.<BR><BR>Now I must ask that you gather some water for me. A standard pitcher of water holds approximately one gallon. Please decant 8 gallons of fresh water into our water vats.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.
1054092	Gather 8 gallons of water for the water vats of the solen ant lair.
1054093	Gallons of Water gathered:
1054094	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet gathered 8 gallons of water. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054095	You've completed your task of gathering water. Return to the Matriarch who gave you this task.
1054096	<I>The Solen Matriarch listens as you report the completion of your tasks to her.</I><BR><BR>I give you my thanks for your help, and I will gladly make you a friend of my solen colony. My warriors, workers, and queens will not longer look at you as an intruder and attack you when you enter our lair.<BR><BR>I will also process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you. Two of the zoogi fungi are required for each measure of the powder. I will process up to 200 zoogi fungi into 100 measures of powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I will also give you some gold for assisting me and my colony, but first let's take care of your zoogi fungus.

1055000	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>What's that?  Who's there?  What do you want with me?  I don't have time for the likes of you.  I have stews to spice and brews to boil.  Too many things to complete to be helping out a stranger.<BR><BR>Besides, it looks as if you've already got yourself a quest that needs doing.  Perhaps if you finish the task you're on, you can return to me and I'll help you out.  But until then, leave an old witch alone to her magics!  Shoo!  Away with ye!<BR><BR><I>The witch rushes you off with a wave of her decrepit hand and returns to tending the noxious brew boiling in her cauldron.</I>
1055001	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>Eh? Who is it? Who's there?  Come to trouble an old woman have you?<BR><BR>I'll split ye open and swallow yer guts!  I'll turn ye into a pile o' goo, I will!  Bah!  As if I didn't have enough to worry about.  As if I've not enough trouble as it is!<BR><BR>Another of my blasted apprentices has gone missing!  Foolish children, think they know everything.  I should turn the lot of them into toads - if only they'd return with their task complete!  But that's the trouble, innit?  They never return!<BR><BR>But you don't care, do ye?  I suppose you're another one of those meddlesome kids, come to ask me for something?  Eh?  Is that it?  You want something from me, expect me to hand it over?  I've enough troubles with my apprentices, and that vile imp, Zeefzorpul!  Why, I bet it's him who's got the lot of them!  And who knows what he's done?  Vile little thing.<BR><BR>If you expect me to help you with your silly little desires, you'll be doing something for me first, eh?  I expect you to go seek out my apprentice.  I sent him along the road west of here up towards Yew's graveyard, but he never came back. Find him, and bring him back, and I'll give you a little reward that I'm sure you'll find pleasant.<BR><BR>But I tells ye to watch out for the imp name've Zeefzorpul!  He's a despicable little beast who likes to fool and fiddle with folk and generally make life miserable for everyone.  If ye get him on your bad side, you're sure to end up ruing the day ye were born. As if you didn't already, with an ugly mug like that!<BR><BR>Well, you little whelp?  Going to help an old hag or not?
1055002	<I>Somewhat out of character for the vile old witch, she actually seems delighted that you've accepted her offer.</I><BR><BR>Ah! That's the spirit! You're not a useless bag of bones after all, are ye?  Well then, best get your hind quarters in gear and head towards the road!  Remember, my young Apprentice could be anywhere along the road heading towards the Yew Graveyard, so be sure to run the whole course of it, and stay on track!<BR><BR>And for Gashnak's sake, come back here when you've found something! And remember, I don't have all day!  And watch out for the imp Zeefzorpul!  And don't return empty handed!  And pack a warm sweater!  And don't trample my lawn on the way out!<BR><BR>What are you still doing here?  Get to it!  Shoo!
1055003	<I>The wrinkled hag looks up at you with venom in her eyes.</I><BR><BR>What're you doing back here?  I thought I told you to go find my lost Apprentice!  I don't have time for your laziness, you wretched little worm!  Shoo! Away with ye! And don't come back until you've found out what's happened to my Apprentice!
1055004	You inspect the charred and bloodied corpse, recognizing it from the Hag's description as the lost Apprentice you were tasked to bring back.<BR><BR>It appears as if he has been scorched by fire and magic, and scratched at with vicious claws.<BR><BR>You wonder if this horrific act is the work of the vile imp Zeefzorpul of which the Hag spoke.  You decide you'd best return to the Hag and report your findings.
1055005	<I>The wrinkled old Hag looks up from her cauldron of boiling innards.</I><BR><BR>Bah!  Back already?  Can't you see I'm busy with my cooking?  You wouldn't like to have a little taste of my delicious dragon gizzard soup, would you?  Haw! I thought as much.<BR><BR>Enough of this jibber-jabber then - what news of my Apprentice?<BR><BR>What's that?  You say that horrible little imp Zeefzorpul was behind his disappearance!?  What would Zeefzorpul want with my Apprentice?  Probably just wants to make life more miserable for me than it already is.<BR><BR>Wait! Bah! That must be it! Zeefzorpul must have found out that I sent my Apprentices out with various Magic Brew Recipes - lists of tasks and ingredients that needed completing.<BR><BR>That despicable Zeefzorpul knows I need the list of ingredients I gave to that Apprentice.  I've recipes to mix, stews to boil, magics to cast, and fortunes to meddle!  I won't let that wretched felchscum spoil my day.  You then, I need you to go find Zeefzorpul and get that scrap of parchment back!<BR><BR>I'm not sure where he bides his time, but I'm sure if you go find his imp friends and rough them up, they'll squeal on him in no time!  They all know each others' secret hiding places.  Go on!  Shoo! Go slay a few imps until they cough up their secrets!  No mercy for those little nasties!
1055006	<I>The sickly old hag looks up from her boiling cauldron.</I><BR><BR>Have you found that vile little Zeefzorpul yet?  What!?  You've come back here without finding out where Zeefzorpul is, and what he's done with my Magic Brew Recipe?<BR><BR>I told you what needs to be done, you little whelp!  Now away with ye!  And don't you return until you've found my list of ingredients!
1055007	<I>The wretched imp cries out for mercy.</I><BR><BR>Forgive me! You master! You great warrior, great hooman, great greatest! Forgive! Forgive! I give up Zeef! He no good any way!  He always smack me head and hurt me good!  He say I ugly too, even with me pretty teef!<BR><BR>But I knows where he hide!  I follow him flapping to his hidey hole.  He think he so smart but he so wrong!  I make scribble drawing of where he like to hide!  But you need the whistle blower to make him come!  He no come without it!  Make with the whistle at his hidey place, and Zeef must come, he cannot resist!<BR><BR><I>The frightened imp hands you a crumpled map and a strange flute.</I><BR><BR>You go to where the picture shows and then you play that whistle!  Zeef come, me promise!  But you make promise that you smack Zeef head good!  Pweese?<BR><BR><I>With this last request, the miserable little imp falls and breathes no more.</I>
1055008	<I>In a puff of smoke that smells of brimstone, the imp Zeefzorpul appears.</I><BR><BR>Wuh-whut!? How did stupid hooman find mighty Zeefzorpul?  This crazy many times!  This crazy not possible! This big crazy with crazy on top!  But it happening!  How can it be true!?<BR><BR>GAH! Even mighty Zeefzorpul can no resist that crazy music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul do what you want!  Have you stupid paper back!  Mighty Zeefzorpul no want it any way.  It dumb.  It super dumb.  Big dumb like stupid dumb tree with dumb things on it!  So stupid!  So dumb that mighty Zeefzorpul not even care!  You see me not caring?  You better cause it certainly happening!  Me not caring one bit!<BR><BR><I>The strange little imp tosses the piece of parchment at you.  Much to your surprise, however, he swoops down in a flash of flapping wings and steals the Magic Flute from your grasp.</I><BR><BR>Hah! So stupid like a hooman!  Mighty Zeefzorpul has defeated stupid hooman and is greatest ever imp in world!  You serious stupid, mister hooman.  Big stupid with stupid on top.  Now you no can make trick on me again with crazy dance music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul fly away to his other secret home where you never find him again!<BR><BR>Me hope you get eated by a troll!<BR><BR><I>With that, the imp Zeefzorpul disappears in another puff of rancid smoke.</I>
1055009	<I>The wart-covered witch looks up from pouring fetid scraps of meat into her cauldron.</I><BR><BR>You've dealt with that troublesome imp Zeefzorpul?  Good for you, little one!  You're not as useless as you appear, even to a daft old wench such as myself!<BR><BR>Now then, I see you've recovered my precious Magic Brew Recipe.  I suppose you expect a reward?  Well, you can go on expecting, and I can go on being ugly.  What good is it to me that I have the list, if I don't have an apprentice to go gather the ingredients and perform the tasks themselves!<BR><BR>If you want your precious little reward, you'll have to complete the task I gave to my previous Apprentice.  Now away with you!  Shoo! Shimmy! Skedattle!  I've heads to boil and stews to spice!  Don't you return until you've completed every item on that list!
1055010	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.<BR><BR>With an excruciatingly slow movement, he pushes back his tricorne hat and stares you down with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Whut tha blazes do ye want, landlubber?  Some've Captain Blackheart's fine Whiskey?  Well ye can drown in the seven seas, ya barnacle-covered bilge rat!<BR><BR>I've cut down pasty-faced runts like yerself for lesser insults!  I've sailed the seas've this world fer fifty years, and never seen a more milk-soaked pansy lass than ye come in here for a favor.  Give ye some of my special Whiskey?  I'd sooner punch a sea serpent naked - and I've done that some twenty times!<BR><BR>Ye see, ol' Captain Blackheart's Whiskey is only for pirate folk.  And ye don't look like no pirate I've ever seen.  Ye have te have the right cut of cloth and the right amount of liquor in yer belly te sail on my crew!  And without that, ye might as well go home and cry to yer mommy.  Cause ye ain't ever gonna share no drink with me!<BR><BR>Now off with ye!<BR><BR><I>With that, Captain Blackheart goes back to singing his bawdy songs and drinking his whiskey.  It seems as if you'll have to find some way to change his mind about your worthiness.</I>
1055011	<I>The drunken pirate, Captain Blackheart, looks up from his bottle of whiskey with a pleased expression.</I><BR><BR>Well looky here!  I didn't think a landlubber like yourself had the pirate blood in ye!  But look at that!  You certainly look the part now!  Sure you can still keep on your feet?  Har!<BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.  Why, a keg of this stuff once spilled on my ship, and it ate a hole right through the deck!<BR><BR>Go on, drink up, or use it to clean the rust off your cutlass - it's the best brew, either way!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart hands you a jug of his famous Whiskey. You think it best to return it to the Hag, rather than drink any of the noxious swill.</I>
1055012	<I>The ancient crone looks up from her bubbling brew, staring you down with her one good eye.</I><BR><BR>You've returned already have you?  And what of your task?  Have you gathered all the needed ingredients?<BR><BR>What's that!?  You still haven't finished the simple little task I've set before you?  Then why come back here and bother me?  I can't get a single brew concocted if you keep bugging me with your whimpering little diatribes!  Why, you're worse than my last apprentice - and he was the very king of fools!<BR><BR>Go on with ye!  Away and begone!  I don't want to see hide nor hair of your whining little face until you've gathered each and every last one of the ingredients on that list!<BR><BR><I>With a disgusting hacking noise, the vile witch spits upon the ground and brushes you off with a wave of her wrinkled old hand.</I>
1055013	<I>The horrible wretch of a witch looks up from her vile experiments and focuses her one good eye on you.</I><BR><BR>Eh?  What's that?  You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well, well, I don't know exactly what to say.  I thought for sure you'd end up dead!  Haw!  Can't blame a lady for wishing, can you?  Even if she is a bit old and wrinkled.<BR><BR>Well, I promised you a reward for your efforts, and I never lie - leastways not to someone like you, after the great sacrifices you've made.  You know, I could use a new Apprentice, in an official capacity as it were.  I couldn't convince you to stay around and help me out some more could I?  There's always cauldrons that need cleaning, dung that needs shoveling, newts eye that needs a proper chewing, and fires that need stoking.<BR><BR>What's that? Not interested?  Well, I suppose you have great things ahead of you and all that. Feh! Like a puckish little puke like you could ever make something of themselves in this cold old world!<BR><BR>Nevertheless, I'll give you your blasted reward, and you'd better be happy with it because it's all you're getting.  Caused me enough trouble as it is.  Here, take it, and be off with you!  It'll be a pleasure to my eye if I never have to squint to see you again!  And the stench!  Smells like you washed this very morning!  A great fancy folk you are, with your soaps and water!  Think you're so great...why, I remember when we didn't even have soap, and water was made by tiny little fairies and cost a gold piece for a thimbleful...I could tell you some stories, I could...<BR><BR><I>Your reward in hand, you decide to leave the old Hag to her mumblings before she realizes you're still around and puts you back to work.</I>

1055054	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.</I><BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Just in from sailin' the glorious sea?  Ye look right ready te fall down on the spot, ye do!<BR><BR>I tell ye what, from the look've ye, ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.

You think it best to return it to the Hag, rather than drink any of the noxious swill.</I>
1055055	You are still attempting to obtain a jug of Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, but the drunkard Captain refuses to share his unique brew.  You must prove your worthiness as a pirate to Blackheart before he'll offer you a jug.
1055056	<I>The inebriated pirate looks up at you with a wry grin.</I><BR><BR>Well hello again, me little matey.  I see ye have a belly full of rotgut in ye.  I bet ye think you're a right hero, ready te face the world.  But as I told ye before, bein' a member of my pirate crew means more'n just being able to hold yer drink.  Ye have te look the part - and frankly, me little barnacle, ye don't have the cut of cloth te fit in with the crowd I like te hang around.<BR><BR>So scurry off, ye wee sewer rat, and don't come back round these parts all liquored up an' three sheets te tha wind, unless yer truly ready te join me pirate crew!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart shoves you aside, banging his cutlass against the table as he calls to the waitress for another round.</I>
1055057	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from polishing his cutlass, glaring at you with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Well, well.  Lookit the wee little deck swabby.  Aren't ye a cute lil' lassy?  Don't ye look just fancy?  Ye think yer ready te join me pirate crew?  Ye think I should offer ye some've me special Blackheart brew?<BR><BR>I'll make ye walk the plank, I will!  We'll see how sweet n' darlin' ye look when the sea serpents get at ye and rip ye te threads!  Won't that be a pretty picture, eh?<BR><BR>Ye don't have the stomach fer the pirate life, that's plain enough te me.  Ye prance around here like a wee lil' princess, ye do.  If ye want to join my crew ye can't just look tha part - ye have to have the stomach fer it, filled up with rotgut until ye can't see straight.  I don't drink with just any ol' landlubber!  Ye'd best prove yer mettle before ye talk te me again!<BR><BR><I>The drunken pirate captain leans back in his chair, taking another gulp of his drink before he starts in on another bawdy pirate song.</I>
1055058	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from his drink, almost tipping over his chair as he looks you up and down.</I><BR><BR>You again?  I thought I told ye te get lost?  Go on with ye!

1055063	<I>The wrinkled old hag stops stirring her noxious stew for a moment to look up at you as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Eh? What's that? You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well now, my little one, I'd like to discuss your reward with you, but it seems you won't have enough room to carry it even if I do provide you with your treat.  Perhaps you'd best remove some items from that overstuffed pack of yours and talk to me when you're ready.<BR><BR><I>The witch goes back to stirring the contents of her bubbling cauldron.  You'd best make room in your pack for the Hag's reward before speaking to her again.</I>
1055064	<I>The wrinkled old crone stops stirring her noxious stew, looking up at you with an annoyed expression on her face.</I><BR><BR>You again? Listen, you little wretch, I'm in no mood for any of your meddlesome requests. I've work to do, and no time for your whining.<BR><BR>Come back later, and maybe I'll have something for you to do. In the meantime, get out of my sight - and don't touch anything on your way out!<BR><BR><I>The vile hag hacks up a gob of phlegm, spitting it on the ground before returning to her work.</I>

1055080	<I>Elwood looks up from his ale as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>What's that? Who me? No, no. You must be looking for someone else.
1055081	<I>Elwood greets you warmly, like an old friend he's not quite sure he ever had.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Yes. Sit down. Please. Good. Okay, stand. Up to you.<BR><BR>So, what brings you to these parts... hey, wait. Just had a thought. Would you like to do me a favor? Yes, really. You know, for old times sake. The good ole days. You were always one of my best suppliers. Or maybe you weren't, who knows any more. Anyway, could use some help supplementing my stock. You know me. Always looking for something new to add to the collection. Or sometimes not so new - just more of the same. But don't have to tell you that. You know, don't you. Yes. Just like old times. That's what it'll be. You and me - together again. Ah, it's been too long.<BR><BR>So what do you think? The fee will be the same as always. I'm a fair man. You know that. So what do you say?
1055082	<I>Elwood looks a bit flustered and nearly knocks over his bottle of ale.</I><BR><BR>Well, I see. It's like that, is it? Yes. Well then. Okay. You've changed. Yes. Yes, you have. Something's changed. I know I haven't. Not me. Not good ole Elwood.<BR><BR><I>Elwood trails off, though you can still hear him muttering softly.</I>
1055083	<I>Elwood slaps his knee and grins at you.</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes. That's the spirit. I knew it. Knew it when I first saw you. You remind me so much of your dear departed father. Or someone. Not sure. Maybe no one. But that's okay. Ah, good times.<BR><BR>Anyway, so as you know, I'm a collector. Got all kinds of interesting things laying around back at my warehouse. You know. You've seen it. Haven't you? Yes? No? Nevermind. Not important.<BR><BR>Right. So, always trying to add new things to my collection. Or sometimes just get more of something. Can't have too many. Right? Yeah? Sure.<BR><BR>Let's see. Where to start. Oh, I know. Pearls. Yes. But not just any pearls. Rainbow pearls. Yes. From the lake here in Haven. Seems all that magic Uzeraan was throwing around when he transformed the island had an interesting effect on some of the shellfish down there. Exactly, rainbow pearls. Useless for magic, but an item worth collecting. Trust me on this. Trust me.<BR><BR>Need you to go fish some up for me. Down at the lake. Lake Haven. Off ya go. Happy fishing!<BR><BR><I>Elwood turns back to his ale and now seems oblivious to you.</I>
1055084	Fish up shellfish from Lake Haven and collect rainbow pearls.
1055085	Rainbow pearls collected:
1055086	You pull a shellfish out of the water, and find a rainbow pearl inside of it.
1055087	You pull a shellfish out of the water, but it doesn't have a rainbow pearl.
1055088	You've collected enough rainbow pearls. Speak to Elwood to give them to him and get your next task.
1055089	<I>Elwood looks up as you tap him on the shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Good. Good. You're back. Wait. You don't have the rainbow pearls I need. Taking a break? Yeah. Sure. There's no hurry. Let me know when you've got all those pearls, though. I'll be here.
1055090	<I>Elwood jumps slightly when you call his name.</I><BR><BR>What. I'm awake. Oh, It's you. Hey, look at those pearls. Beautiful. Wow. Where'd you get those... oh right. I sent you to get them. From the lake. Lake Haven. Great job. Gotta love rainbow pearls. Oooh, Colors.<BR><BR>Okay, let's see. Next. Need a painting. Go to the Colored Canvas and speak to Alberta. Alberta Giacco. Best painter I've ever met. Ask her to do a painting of you. Yes. Of you. A portrait. Never know if you might up and become famous one day. Need to have a painting of you in my collection. From now. Before all the fame. Go. Alberta awaits. She's in Vesper.<BR><BR><I>Elwood starts playing with the pearls you brought him and seems to have forgotten you're there.</I>
1055091	Go to Vesper and speak to Alberta Giacco at the Colored Canvas.
1055092	<I>Alberta looks up from the painting she is working on and faces you.</I><BR><BR>Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in the middle of something, and can't... oh wait, I see. You must be the one Elwood sent over.<BR><BR>Very well. If you'll have a seat on the stool over there, we'll get started. This will just take a few seconds. I paint quite quickly, you see. I'll start once you are seated.<BR><BR><I>Alberta exchanges the painting she was working on for a blank canvas.</I>
1055093	Sit on the stool in front of Alberta's easel so that she can paint your portrait. You'll need to sit there for about 30 seconds.
1055094	<I>Elwood yawns and stretches, then focuses his gaze on you.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Do I know you? Hold on a second. Yes. Yes, I do. You were going to bring me some rainbow pearls. Wait. No. You already did that. I remember now. Right. So go get that portrait painted. Alberta is in Vesper. Go to her. Alberta Giacco. Come back when she's done.
1055095	You must remain seated on the stool until the portrait is complete. Alberta will now have to start again with a fresh canvas.
1055096	<I>Alberta looks at you sympathetically.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, this will only take a few seconds. I realize that stool can be uncomfortable, and I apologize for that. Perhaps I should replace it with a more comfortable chair. But then again, it's that very discomfort that helps produce such wonderful facial expressions for my paintings. Ah well.
1055097	<I>Elwood drums his fingers on the counter then looks up at you expectantly.</I><BR><BR>Ah, finally. I'm famished. This so-called tavern doesn't even serve pizza, so one must have it delivered. It's an outrage. Er... wait. Where's my pizza? Yes, my pizza. What kind of delivery is this? Didn't even bring my pizza. This will severely impact your tip, I'm afraid.<BR><BR>Hold on a moment. You were helping me with something else, weren't you? Ah. Yes. I've got it now. You were to have a portrait done. Well. Good. Yes. But let's not dawdle. Off you go. If you happen to see anyone with my pizza, please insist they hurry.<BR><BR>
1055098	<I>Alberta stands back from the canvas and surveys her work.</I><BR><BR>Not too bad. Quite good even, if I do say so myself. As always, of course.<BR><BR>Oh, you're still here. Please let Elwood know that the painting has been completed. I'll have it sent to him once it dries.<BR><BR><I>Alberta removes the portrait from her easel and sets it aside to dry.</I>
1055099	Return to Elwood and let him know that the painting is complete.
1055100	<I>Elwood notices you immediately and waves you over.</I><BR><BR>You're back. Good. That's good. Hmm. You don't seem to have that painting yet. Don't tell me Alberta refused. That's no good. I made her what she is! She was living in the gutter when I found her. The gutter. And she has the... what's that? Oh, she finished the portrait. Right. Good. Can always count on Alberta. Always. Best painter in the land.<BR><BR>Just have a couple... er... wait... make that... two more task for you. Then our business will be concluded. For now. Old chums like us will always work together again. Yes. We go so far back. Right. I think.<BR><BR>Anyway. There's a musician. A minstrel. His name's Gabriel Piete. Quite the good singer. One of my favorites. Absolute favorite. What I'd like is his autograph. Simple. Just his autograph. You're likely to find him at the Conservatory of Music in Britain. He's often there. Often. Between performances. Hurry now. There ya go.<BR><BR><I>Elwood falls silent though his lips are still  moving. It looks like he's quietly repeating the word, "autograph."</I>
1055101	Go to Britain and obtain the autograph of renowned minstrel, Gabriel Piete. He is often found at the Conservatory of Music.
1055102	<I>Alberta stops cleaning her brushes and looks your way.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, I'll send the painting to Elwood once it's dry. Please let him know that the painting has been finished.
1055103	<I>Gabriel sighs loudly as you address him and stops whatever it was that he was doing.</I><BR><BR>WHAT?!? Can you not see that I'm working here?  Ugh, sometimes I wish they'd just lock the outer doors to anyone who doesn't belong here. So go ahead and fawn. Get it over with, and then leave. Sooner you're out of here, the sooner I'm back to work.<BR><BR>I see. So you want an autograph. Fine. If it'll get rid of you, I'll give you my autograph. But I'll only sign some sheet music for one of my songs. Until then, please let me get back to work.<BR><BR>You can probably find some of my sheet music at one of the theaters in the land. When I perform there, they often sell it as a souvenir. Speak to the impresario... the theater manager. My last three performances were in Nujel'm, Jhelom, and here in Britian.
1055104	Find some sheet music for one of Gabriel's songs. Try speaking to an impresario from one of the theaters in the land.
1055105	<I>Elwood jumps and almost falls from his stool when you tap his shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Oh my. Don't do that. Scared me half to death. Sneaking up on people like that. I don't even know you. Yes, I do. I do know you. Ordered a pizza from you and never received it. I'm rather miffed about that.<BR><BR>No. No. Wait. Of course. Not the pizza. You're here with the moonfire brew I wanted. Magical moonfire brew. Not sure what it is. Just want some.<BR><BR>What's that? Oh. The autograph. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Of course. Do you have it? No. Well. Hmm. Don't sneak up on people like that. Not polite.
1055106	Sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song? No, I'm sorry, but we've run out. We might get some more after he performs here again, but right now we don't have any. My apologies.
1055107	Sure, I have some sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song. I'd be happy to sell you a copy for 10 gold.
1055108	You don't have enough gold to buy the sheet music.
1055109	The theater impresario hands you some sheet of music for one of Gabriel Piete's songs.
1055110	Speak to Gabriel to have him autograph the sheet music.
1055111	<I>Gabriel does not look happy to see you.</I><BR><BR>Do you have any sheet music? No. Please return when you do, but until then please leave me to my work.
1055112	<I>Elwood seems to be studying the bottom of his bottle of ale as you approach.</I><BR><BR>What's this? Strange. Quite strange. I could have sworn I was drinking wine.<BR><BR>Oh, hello. Yes. Good to see you. Any luck with that autograph?  Bet you thought I'd forgotten. No. Not me. Mind like a steel trap. Can't get it open no matter how hard you try. Or something. No luck yet? Ah well. keep trying. I have faith in you. Whoever you are.
1055113	<I>Gabriel looks up impatiently as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Good. We can finally be done with one another. Here, let me sign that and have this business completed.<BR><BR><I>Gabriel takes the sheet music, autographs it, and then hands it back to you.</I>
1055114	Speak to Elwood to give him the autographed sheet music.
1055115	<I>Elwood scratches his ear then notices you.</I><BR><BR>Good day. What brings you to the Albatross? Me? An autograph? You want my autograph? Well, I suppose. What's that? Oh. Yes. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Get his autograph and return to me. Good day.
1055116	<I>Elwood looks up eagerly as you tell him about the autographed sheet music.</I><BR><BR>Quite good work. Not an easy one to deal with, that one. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Well done. Nice autograph.<BR><BR>One last task. I would like a set of toy monster figurines made by the famous toymaker, Tomas O'Neerlan. You'll find him in Trinsic. He's often at the Tinker's Guild. Try looking there.<BR><BR>You're doing quite well. Quite well indeed. Knew you would. Just like old times. Yes. Quite good.
1055117	Go to Trinsic and speak to Tomas O'Neerlan, the famous toymaker.
1055118	<I>Gabriel ignores you.</I>
1055119	<I>Tomas smiles freely as you speak to him.</I><BR><BR>Ah, to be sure I can make you some toy monster figurines. That's my work, making toys. Worry not, we'll put together a good set of monsters for you and your figurines.<BR><BR>But I'll be needing something from you before I can begin. Here, take these enchanted paints. Using them, you can capture a set of images of the creatures you wish me to make into toys. It'll only work on the group of creatures I select for your set of figurines. Oh, and I'll be needing those enchanted paints back when all is said and done.<BR><BR>
1055120	Use the enchanted paints to capture the image of all of the creatures listed below.
1055121	Complete
1055122	Incomplete
1055123	<I>You watch as Elwood spins around blissfully on his stool.</I><BR><BR>Oh. Forgive me. Didn't see you there. Whoo. Dizzy. Can't see straight. Have you gotten those figurines yet? No. Ah. Not to worry. Keep at it. No doubt you'll come through with those.<BR><BR>Excuse me a moment. I think I need to sit down. Wait. I am sitting down. Good then. Yes. Sitting down.<BR><BR><I>Elwood reaches out and takes hold of the counter as if to steady himself.</I>
1055124	You have no interest in capturing the image of this creature.
1055125	The enchanted paints swirl for a moment then an image begins to take shape. *Click*

1055127	a painted image
1055128	You now have all of the creature images you need. Return to Tomas O'Neerlan so that he can make the toy figurines.
1055129	<I>Tomas greets you warmly as you approach.</I><BR><BR>'Tis good to see you. I see that you have not yet collected all of the images we need. 'Tis fine, but I'll be needing those before I can make the toy figurines. Return when you have the complete set of images.<BR><BR>
1055130	<I>Elwood suddenly stops and beckons you over to him.</I><BR><BR>Over here. Come here. Don't be alarmed, but I think one of the tavernkeepers used to be a wandering healer. Said something about the good ole days when people would just walk up and hand gold to them. Piles of gold. Out of the blue. Can you imagine? Got so much gold, this ex-healer decided to buy a tavern and settle down. Kind of sad really. Can't even cure my hangover now. Nice tavern though.<BR><BR>Right. Anyway. Let me know when those toy figurines are ready. I'll be here. As always.
1055131	<I>Tomas grins as you walk toward him.</I><BR><BR>I see that you have collected all of the images we need. 'Tis good. I'll begin straight away on the toy figurines. I'll have them delivered to you when ready. Where shall I send them? To Elwood in Haven? Yes, I know him. We've done business in the past. Odd fellow.<BR><BR>Tomas smiles as you return his enchanted paints back to him.<BR><BR>
1055132	Return to Elwood with news that the toy figurines will be delivered when ready.
1055133	<I>Elwood is singing as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>Come. Join in. It's a Gabriel Piete song. I have the sheet music for it. It's even autographed by Gabriel Piete himself. Yes. One of his songs. Brilliant.<BR><BR>So let me see the toys. Figurines. Let's see them. Oh. You don't have them yet. I see. Well. Okay. That's too bad.
1055134	<I>Elwood takes a sip of his ale as you address him.</I><BR><BR>Ah. That's the stuff. Ale. Nothing better. What's that? Toy figurines will be delivered. Right. Yes. Perhaps better than Ale. Tough one.<BR><BR>Very good work. Quite. Think we're all done now. You completed everything I asked. Would work with you again. Yes. We should.<BR><BR>Ah. Yes. your payment. The usual. I think you'll be pleased.<BR><BR><I>With that Elwood rummages around in his backpack. He eventually pulls out a small bag and hands it to you.</I>
1055135	<I>Elwood stares at you as you approach.</I><BR><BR>I know you. Oh yes. You've been running some errands for me. We are about done. Noticed that your backpack is a bit full. Might want to make some room. Won't be able to hold your payment. Come back when you have more room, and we'll conclude our business.
1055136	Return to Elwood for your reward when you have some room in your backpack.

1060004	Securely Replace This House
1060005	You are attempting to replace your current house.  Your house will vanish and the land it occupies will be outlined in red.  For 10 minutes, only you will be allowed to place a house over the red-outlined land.  You can use any house placement tool to place any house type in a new location near to or directly on the reserved land.  If you successfully place a new house, the land reservation markings will disappear and others may attempt to place houses in that area.  If you fail to place a new house in 10 minutes, die, log out, or move more than 30 tiles from the center of the reserved land, your original house will reappear at its previous location.  All of your locked down and secure items will be preserved in a House Moving Crate while you do this.  Are you sure you wish to continue?
1060006	Make This House Customizable
1060007	More than ten minutes have passed since you initiated House Replacement.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.
1060008	You have moved more than 30 tiles away from the center of your original house, or you have crossed subserver boundaries.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.
1060009	You have died, lost connection, or logged out.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.

All of the items in your original house have been relocated to a Moving Crate in the new house.  Any deed-based house add-ons have been converted back into deeds.  Vendors and barkeeps in the house, if any, have been stored in the Moving Crate as well.  Use the <B>Get Vendor</B> context-sensitive menu option on your character to retrieve them.  These containers can be used to re-create the vendor in a new location.  Any barkeepers have been converted into deeds.
1060013	You are about to turn your house into a customizable house.  You will be refunded the value of this house, and then be charged the cost of the equivalent customizable dirt lot.  All of your possessions in the house will be transported to a Moving Crate.  Deed-based house add-ons will be converted back into deeds.  Vendors and barkeeps will also be stored in the Moving Crate.  Your house will be leveled to its foundation, and you will be able to build new walls, windows, doors, and stairs.  Are you sure you wish to continue?

1060094	<I>An old man who looks to be 200 years old from the looks of his translucently pale and heavily wrinkled skin, turns to you and gives you a half-cocked grin that makes you feel somewhat uneasy.<BR><BR> After a short pause, he begins to speak to you...</I><BR><BR>Hmm. What's this?  Another budding Necromancer to join the ranks of Evil?  Here... let me take a look at you...  Ah yes...  Very Good! I sense the forces of evil are strong within you, child – but you need training so that you can learn to focus your skills against those aligned against our cause.  You are destined to become a legendary Necromancer - with the proper training, that only I can give you.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth pauses just long enough to give you a wide, skin-crawling grin.</I><BR><BR>Let me introduce myself.  I am Mardoth, the guildmaster of the Necromantic Brotherhood.  I have taken it upon myself to train anyone willing to learn the dark arts of Necromancy.  The path of destruction, decay and obliteration is not an easy one.  Only the most evil and the most dedicated can hope to master the sinister art of death.<BR><BR>I can lend you training and help supply you with equipment – in exchange for a few services rendered by you, of course.  Nothing major, just a little death and destruction here and there - the tasks should be easy as a tasty meat pie for one as treacherous and evil as yourself.<BR><BR>What do you say?  Do we have a deal?
1060095	Dark Tides
1060096	Cadalyte Scales
1060097	You have no idea how to work this fabric.
1060099	Excellent choice, young apprentice of evil!<BR><BR>I will not waste our time with pleasantries.  There is much work to be done – especially in light of the recent Knight ambushes that we have suffered.  The necromantic brotherhood is working towards the summoning of the elder daemon Kronus, who will rise from the Well of Tears to help us finally crush the Knight forces that have plagued our lands for so long now.<BR><BR>To summon Kronus, we must energize the Well of Tears with a series of dark rituals.  Unfortunately the rituals needed to sufficiently energize the Well of Tears have been lost to us.  Your task will be to recover one of the ritual scrolls needed for the summoning.<BR><BR>You will need to find the corpse of the Arch Necromancer Maabus, which has been laid to rest in the tomb of elders.  We believe his spirit may have memory of where we may find the scrolls needed for the summoning.  You will need to awaken him from the slumber of death, using your Animate Dead spell, of course.<BR><BR>To reach the tomb, step onto the magical teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing.<BR><BR>Once you have been teleported, follow the path, which will lead you to the tomb of Maabus.<BR><BR>One more thing before you go:<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry. I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>. Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this tower.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.
1060100	...
1060101	...
1060102	Re-animate the corpse of Maabus using your <a href="?ForceTopic112">Animate Dead</a> spell and question him about the Kronus rituals.
1060103	<I>Maabus emits an ear-crawling screech as his body reanimates.  He turns and angrily screams at you</I>:<BR><BR>YOU INFIDEL!  HOW DARE YOU AWAKEN MAABUS!?!<BR><BR><I>Maabus continues to scream at you angrily for some time.  As he settles down, you explain to him the purpose of your visit.  Once you explain that you are on a quest to summon the elder daemon Kronus, Maabus begins to cooperate, and begins to speak in a more reasonable tone</I>:<BR><BR>Well, why didn’t you say so?  If you’re going to raise Kronus from the Well of Tears, you must first complete a long series of dark rituals.  I once owned one of the scrolls needed for the summoning, but alas it was lost to me when I lost my life to a cowardly Knight ambush near the Knight city of Light.  They would have probably hidden the scroll in their precious crystal cave near the city.<BR><BR>There is a teleporter in the corner of this tomb.  It will transport you near the crystal cave at which I believe one of the calling scrolls is hidden.  Good luck.<BR><BR><I>Maabus' body slumps back into the coffin as your magic expires</I>.
1060104	Take the teleporter in the corner of Maabus' tomb to the crystal cave where the calling scroll is kept.
1060105	<I>An old man, dressed in slightly tattered armor, whom you recognize to be a Knight stands before the Crystal Cave staring blankly into the space in front of him.  As he begins to speak to you, you realize this man is blind.  You attempt to persuade the blind man that you are a Knight seeking to inspect the scroll of calling...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>You seek entrance to the Crystal Cave, home of the Calling Scroll?  Hmm.  You reak of death and decay, brother.  You reak of death like a Necromancer, but yet you claim to be a Knight in hopes that I will grant thee passage into the cave?<BR><BR>Please don’t think ill of me for this, but I’m just a blind, old man looking to keep the brotherhood of Knights safe from the clutches of the elder daemon Kronus.  The Necromancers have been after this particular scroll for quite some time, so we must take all the security precautions we can.<BR><BR>Before I can let you pass into the Crystal Cave, you must speak to me the secret word that is kept in the Scroll of Abraxus in the Vault of Secrets at the Knight city of Light.  It’s the only way that I can be sure you are who you claim to be, since Necromancers cannot enter the Vault due to powerful protective magic that the brotherhood has blessed the vault with.
1060106	Infiltrate the city of the Knights and figure out a way into the Vault. See Mardoth for help with this objective.
1060107	<I>Mardoth looks at you expectantly until you tell him that you failed to retrieve the scroll...</I><BR><BR>You failed?  Very unfortunate...  So now you must find your way into the knight’s Vault of Secrets, eh?  Well, you won't be able to get in – there is a powerful magic aura that protects the Vault from all Necromancers.  We simply cannot enter.  However, that's not to say your familiar spirit can't.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth grins with obvious satisfaction as he explains the details of the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell to you...</I>, which will allow you to summon a scavenging Horde Minion to steal the scroll.<BR><BR>Very well.  You are prepared to go.  Take the teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing to transport to the Knight city of Light.  Once you have arrived in the city, follow the road of glowing runes to the Vault of Secrets.  You know what to do.
1060108	Use the teleporter near Mardoth to be transported to the Knight City of Light.
1060109	Follow the road paved with glowing runes to find the Vault of Secrets.  Be careful not to give yourself away as a Necromancer while in the city.
1060110	You have arrived in the Vault of Secrets.  You can feel the protective magic in this place restricting you, making you feel nearly claustrophobic.<BR><BR>Just ahead of you and out of your reach, you see a collection of scrolls and books, one of them being entitled 'Scroll of Abraxus' .  You can only assume that this scroll holds the current password required to enter the Crystal Cave.<BR><BR>This would be a good opportunity to <a href="?ForceTopic127">summon your familiar</a>.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds the Vault.<BR><BR>Summon your familiar with the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell.
1060111	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the book for you.
1060112	This would be a good opportunity to summon your familiar.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds this Vault.<BR><BR><a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon your familiar</a> and will it to fetch the book for you.
1060113	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the scroll for you.
1060114	You have obtained the Scroll of Abraxus, which contains the secret password needed to gain passage into the Crystal Cave where the Scroll of Calling is kept.  Read the scroll (double click) and figure out the password.<BR><BR>Once you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave and speak the password to the guard.<BR><BR>If you do not know the way to the Crystal Cave from the Knight City, you can use the magic teleporter located just outside of the vault.
1060115	Now that you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave to speak with the guard there.  Use the teleporter outside of the vault to get there if necessary.
1060116	Security at the Crystal Cave<BR><BR>We have taken great measures to ensure the safety of the Scroll of Calling, which we have so valiantly taken from the Necromancer Maabus during the battle of the wood nearly 200 years ago.<BR><BR>The scroll must never fall into the hands of the Necromancers again, lest they use it to summon the ancient daemon Kronus.  The scroll of calling is a necessity in the series of dark rites the Necromancers must perform to once again re-awaken Kronus.<BR><BR>Should Kronus ever rise again, the days of the Knights, and indeed humanity as we know it will be numbered.<BR><BR>For this reason, we have posted the honorable Horus, former General of the Northern Legions to guard the entrance of the Crystal Cave where we keep the Scroll of Calling.  Horus was infused with magical life from the tree Urywen during his last battle.  The power gave him eternal life, but it also, unfortunately, took his eye sight.<BR><BR>Since Horus cannot see those he admits to the Crystal Cave, he will only allow those that know the secret password to enter.  Speak the following word to Horus and he shall grant you passage to the Crystal Cave:<BR><BR><I>Urywen</I><BR><BR>Do not speak this password anywhere except when seeking passage into the Crystal Cave, as our adversaries are lurking in the shadows – they are everywhere.<BR><BR>Go with the light, friend.<BR><BR><I>- Frater Melkeer</I>
1060117	Speak the secret word that you read in the scroll stolen from the Vault to Horus the guard, using his <a href="?ForceTopic90">context menu</a>.
1060118	Very well Knight, you have proven to me your identity.  I grant thee passage.<BR><BR>Be careful, however – I’ve heard that the cave has been infested with a vermin of some sort.  Our High Lord Melkeer was supposed to send some troops to clear the vermin out of the cave, but that was last week already.  I fear that he forgot.<BR><BR>If you can find it in your goodness to dispose of at least 5 of those vermin in there, I shall reward your efforts.  If however you are too busy, and I would understand if you were, don’t bother with the vermin.<BR><BR>You may now pass through the energy barrier to enter the Crystal Cave.   Take care honorable Knight soul.  Walk in the light my friend.
1060119	Enter the Crystal Cave and find the Scroll of Calling.  The barrier will now allow you to pass.
1060120	You rummage through the scrolls until you find the Scroll of Calling.  You quickly put it in your pack.
1060121	You have returned with the scroll!  I knew I could count on you.  You can now perform the rite of calling at the Well of Tears.  This ritual will help charge the Well to prepare for the coming of Kronus.   You are prepared to do your part young Necromancer!<BR><BR>Just outside of this tower, you will find a path lined with red lanterns.  Follow this path to get to the Well of Tears.  Once you have arrived at the Well, use the scroll to perform the ritual of calling.  Performing the rite will empower the well and bring us that much closer to the arrival of Kronus.<BR><BR>Once you have completed the ritual, return here for your promised reward.
1060122	STOP WICKED ONE!
1060123	I will slay you before I allow you to complete your evil rites!
1060124	Step onto the teleporter near Mardoth and follow the path of glowing runes to the tomb of Maabus.
1060125	Find the Crystal Cave password by reading (double click) the golden scroll entitled "Scroll of Abraxus" that you got from your familiar..
1060126	You have disposed of the creatures as Horus has asked. See him on your way out of the Crystal Cave to claim your reward.
1060127	You have obtained the scroll of calling. See Mardoth for further instructions.
1060128	Follow the red lanterns to the Well of Tears where you will perform the calling of Kronus.
1060129	You have arrived at the well, but no longer have the scroll of calling.  Use Mardoth's teleporter to return to the Crystal Cave and fetch another scroll from the box.
1060130	Use the Scroll of Calling (double click) near the Well of Tears to charge the waters for the arrival of Kronus.
1060131	Victory! You have done as Mardoth has asked of you. Take as much of your foe's loot as you can carry and return to Mardoth for your reward.
1060132	Although you were slain by the cowardly knight, you managed to complete the rite of calling as instructed. Return to Mardoth.
1060133	You have done as I asked... I knew I could count on you from the moment you walked in here!<BR><BR>The forces of evil are strong within you.  You will become a great Necromancer in this life - perhaps even the greatest.<BR><BR>My work for you is done here.  I release you from my service to go into the world and fight for our cause...<BR><BR>Oh...I almost forgot - your reward.  Here is a magical weapon and 2000 gold for you, in the form of a check.  Don't spend it all in one place though, eh?<BR><BR>Actually, before you can spend any of it at all, you will have to <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a> at the nearest bank.  Shopkeepers never accept checks for payment, they require cash.<BR><BR>In your pack, you will find an enchanted sextant.  Use this sextant to guide you to the nearest bank.<BR><BR>Farewell, and stay true to the ways of the shadow...
1060134	Use the enchanted sextant in your pack to locate the nearest bank.  Go there and speak with the Banker.
1060135	My new string
1060136	Locate the nearest Bank using the enchanted sextant in your pack.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1060137	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer! I see you've learned how to cash checks. Wonderful! Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land. For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Britain, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Moonglow or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure. So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself. Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia! We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow! May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1060138	<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time, simply by returning to Mardoth's home and speaking with him using his context menu.<BR><BR>
1060139	You have made my work easy for me, ~1_NAME~.  My task here is done.

1060209	<I>Uzeraan greets you as you approach...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>I am Uzeraan, the lord of this house and overseer of this fine city, Haven.  I know we have just met, but time is short and we need to reinforce the troops in the mountain pass, so I will not waste your time with pleasantries.<BR><BR>We have been trying to fight back the wicked <I>Horde Minions</I> which have recently begun attacking our cities - but to no avail.  We desperately need help!<BR><BR>Your first task will be to assess the situation in the mountain pass, and help our troops defeat the Horde Minions there.<BR><BR>Before I send you into battle however, it is time that I teach you a thing or two about the way of the Knight.<BR><BR><U>The Knight</U><BR><BR>Knights are the holy warriors of the realm who have dedicated themselves as protectors of the virtues and vanquishers of all that is evil.<BR><BR>Knights have several <a href = "?ForceTopic111">special abilities</a> that are not available to the ordinary warrior. Due to the spiritual nature of these abilities, the Knight requires some amount of mana to activate them. In addition to mana, the Knight is also required to spend a certain amount of <a href = "?ForceTopic109">tithing points</a> each time a special ability is used.<BR><BR>Tithing points and mana are automatically consumed when a special Knight ability is activated. All Knight abilities are activated through the <a href = "?ForceTopic114">Book of Knightship</a><BR><BR>Go now, to the shrine just East of here, just before the doors and <a href = "?ForceTopic109">tithe</a> at least 500 gold.<BR><BR>Return here when you are done.

Due to the spiritual nature of these abilities, the Knight requires some amount of mana to activate them.

1060211	<I>Cleanse by Fire</I> is the basic Cure ability for the Knight.  The Knight uses the Cleanse by Fire ability to neutralize any poisons from a target.  When he does this, he takes an amount of fire damage based on a combination of his Karma and Knightship levels.  The lower the Knight's Karma, the higher the fire damage.  The higher the Knight's Knightship skill is, the lower the amount of fire damage taken.
1060212	<I>Close Wounds</I> is the basic healing ability for a Knight.  Using this ability, allows the Knight to target another player or creature for divine healing.  The amount of Hit Points healed depends on the Knight’s level of Karma and their skill in Knightship.  A lower level of Karma lowers the amount of healing but a higher skill level in Knightship will raise the amount.
1060213	The <I>Consecrate Weapon</I> ability allows the Knight to temporarily imbue the weapon he is holding with holy magic.<BR><BR> The result is a weapon that deals damage of a type equal to the target’s worst resistance.  In other words,  if a consecrated weapon attacks a Fire Elemental, whose worst resistance is to cold, each hit with the Consecrated Weapon will deal cold damage to that fire elemental.<BR><BR>The duration of the effect is based off of the Knight's level of Karma and Knightship skill.  Lower Karma will shorten the effect, but higher Knightship skill will lengthen the effect.
1060214	The <I>Dispel Evil</I> Knight ability affects a small area around the Knight.  Any evil creatures that come into the affected area may be destroyed or repelled, causing them to flee from combat.  This ability targets evil summoned creatures as well as non-summoned evil creatures.<BR><BR><I>Dispel Evil</I> can also target player Necromancers that are under effect of the <I>Wraith Form</I> spell.   The ability will cause transformed Necromancers to suffer some amount of Mana and Stamina loss.<BR><BR>The chance for successful use of this ability is modified by the Knight's level of Karma and Knightship skill.  While lower Karma will decrease the effectiveness of this ability, higher skill in Knightship will increase it's effectiveness.
1060215	The Knight’s <I>Divine Fury</I> ability allows him to wage a raging battle against the forces of evil, causing him to swing faster, hit better, and do more damage.  While under the effect of this Holy Fury, the Knight's ability to defend himself is severely lowered.<BR><BR>In order to commit himself to the proper state of mind for this ability, the Knight must be at full mana.
1060216	Your shot was successful
1060217	The <I>Enemy of One</I> Knight ability causes the <I>next</I> creature the Knight strikes to become his “mortal enemy”.  For the duration of the effect, whenever the Knight strikes a creature that is his sworn “mortal enemy”, his damage is greatly increased.<BR><BR>Because the Knight is so completely focused on a specific enemy type, however, all other creature types will have their damage against the Knight increased when they strike him.
1060218	The Knight’s <I>Holy Light</I> ability is the only direct-damage ability that the Knight possesses.  Calling on the powers of his faith, he may call forth a magnificent beacon of holy light which damages all enemies in a small radius around the caster.
1060219	The Knight’s <I>Noble Sacrifice</I> ability allows him to sacrifice himself for the greater good of those in the area.  When the ability is used, the Knight is taken down to one (1) Hit Point, one (1) Stamina, and one (1) Mana.<BR><BR>In response to the Knight's sacrifice, all of the dead in the affected area are offered resurrection, while all of the living are Cured and Healed.
1060220	The Knight’s <I>Remove Curse</I> ability allows him to remove all <I>Curse</I> type effects from a single target.  Curses include all Necromancer curses, as well as the spells Feeblemind, Clumsy, Weaken, and Paralyze.
1060221	The Knight ability <I>Sacred Journey</I> mimics the mage spell of <I>Recall</I> almost exactly, in that it allows a Knight to instantly travel to any location for which he has a marked recall rune.<BR><BR>The Knight cannot take a <I>Sacred Journey</I> if he is targeting or is being targeted by any creature, or is in combat.
1060222	Tithing points are gained by tithing gold to the Virtue Shrines.  A Knight who tithes gold to the shrine is making manifest his devotion to the concepts and beliefs that the Shrines exemplify.<BR><BR>Once gained through an act of tithing, these 'points' may be used by the Knight to summon the divine abilities granted to his class.<BR><BR>Each use of a Knight Ability consumes Tithing Points in addition to the pure energy of Mana.
1060223	Players may tithe gold to the Virtue Shrines by opening the context sensitive menu interface on the shrine's Ankh.  There they may choose the <a href="?ForceTopic109">Tithe Gold</a> option, which will bring up the Tithing Interface.  The Tithing Interface lists the amount of gold the player is currently holding.  The player may then use the four arrows to convert Gold into Tithing points and vice versa.<BR><BR>When the <I>OK</I> button is clicked, the player's tithed Gold will be converted into the listed amount of Tithing Points.
1060224	The Knight has many special abilities he can call forth through the use of his <I>Book of Knightship</I>.<BR><BR>The Book Of Knightship can be thought of as the Knight's spell book.  To use an ability, simply open the Book of Knightship to the appropriate page and double click the icon of the ability you wish to activate<BR><BR>The following abilities are available to the Knight at various points of his development:<BR><BR>* Cleanse by Fire<BR>* Close Wounds<BR>* Consecreate Weapon<BR>* Dispel Evil<BR>* Divine Fury<BR>* Enemy of One<BR>* Holy Light<BR>* Noble Sacrifice<BR>* Remove Curse<BR>* Sacred Journey

1061405	Transforms the Caster into an ethereal Wraith, lowering some Elemental Resists, while increasing their Physical resist.

1061493	Attempts to dispel evil summoned creatures and cause other evil creatures to flee from combat.  Transformed Necromancers may also take Stamina and Mana Damage.  Caster’s Karma and Knightship, and Target’s Fame or Necromancy affect Dispel chance.
1061494	Temporarily increases the caster's swing speed, chance to hit, and damage dealt while lowering the Knight's defense chance. Upon casting, the Knight's Stamina is also refreshed by an amount based on caster's Knightship skill and Karma. Bonus effects and the duration of the spell is also affected by Caster's Karma and Knightship skill.
1061495	The next target hit becomes the Knight’s Mortal Enemy.  All damage dealt to that exact creature type is increased, but the Knight takes extra damage from all other creature types. Mortal Enemy creature types will highlight Orange to the Knight.  Duration of the spell is affected by the Caster’s Karma.
1061496	Deals energy damage to all valid targets in a radius around the caster. Amount of damage dealt is affected by Caster’s Karma.

1061679	Spiritualism
1061680	The Spiritualism skill is used to heal yourself by channeling spiritual energy.  Spiritual energy may be channeled from either a corpse or the person using the skill.

1062115	Housing
1062116	This topic covers the basics of housing in UO, from placement to trading to customization.  Please see Related Topics above for more information.
1062117	HOUSE PLACEMENT
1062118	You can create a house by using a <B>house placement tool</B>.  This device can be purchased from an Architect NPC in many towns across the land.  The tool itself is inexpensive, but in order to place a house you will need to have sufficient funds in your bank box to pay for it.  In addition to the tool and funds, you must also have an open spot of land outside of town that is level and free of obstructions.  If you have found such a spot, then double-click your House Placement Tool and choose the type of house to place from the menu.  Next, you will see a ghosted image of the selected house on your targeting cursor.  Position the ghosted house and click to try to place it.  If placement fails, you will be notified as to the reason, and you can try again.  There are several important rules about house placement, which are detailed in the paragraphs following: <a href = "?136">Location</a>, <a href = "?137">Terrain</a>, <a href = "?138">Other Houses</a>, <a href = "?139">Ownership Restrictions</a>.
1062119	LOCATIONS
1062120	<B>Locations:</B>  <a href = "?135" >House placement</a> is not allowed within the boundaries of any town or other region protected by guards.  Housing is also not allowed near any dungeon entrance or shrine.  The area known as the Lost Lands, and the entire facet of Ilshenar are also not suitable for housing.  Finally, some areas have been reserved for other reasons.  When you try to place in these illegal locations, you will be informed that housing is not allowed there.
1062121	TERRAIN
1062122	<B>Terrain:</B>  Houses can only be <a href = "?135">built</a> on level terrain that is free of obstruction.  The entire plot of land that your new house will rest on must all be completely flat.  Furthermore, the house's foundation and front steps cannot rest on any obstruction, or be adjacent to any obstruction.  An obstruction is considered to be a part of the landscape that a player cannot walk over.  Obstructions may exist <B>under</B> the house, so long as they are not tall enough to poke up through the floor of the house.  It must be possible to walk all the way around the house staying adjacent to its walls or front steps, without being blocked by anything on the terrain.
1062123	OTHER HOUSES
1062124	<B>Other Houses:</B>  When <a href = "?135">placing a new house</a>, remember that no two houses can be adjacent in the east/west direction -- there must be an unobstructed path at least one tile wide between any two houses.  Also, there is a five-tile buffer zone to the north and south of a house that must remain clear of all other houses.  Finally, you cannot place a house whose corner is adjacent diagonally to the corner of another house.
1062125	OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS
1062126	<B>Ownership Restrictions:  </B>You may only <a href = "?135">place</a> or be <a href = "?140">traded</a> a house once every 7 days.  You may only own one house on your account.  If you place or receive a second house, any other house(s) on your account, across all shards, will become <a href = "?97">condemned</a>.
1062127	HOUSE TRADING
1062128	You can buy a house from another player or sell a house to another player, using the standard Trade Window.  It is not possible to exchange houses this way.  In order to have a house traded to you, you must meet all house <a href = "?139">ownership restrictions</a>.  If you do, then it is possible for the house owner to open a trade window containing a house trade scroll.  For this to happen, both you and the house owner must be outside the house and standing within two paces of the house sign.  You both must remain within 2 tiles of the house sign or the trade will fail.  The trade scroll shows the name of the house owner, the name of the house, and the sextant coordinates of the house.  This scroll is also a distinctive ice-blue color that cannot be faked.  <B>Be sure to verify you are buying the correct house!</B>  Once both parties double-check the trade and agree to it, the house is transferred.
1062129	HOUSE CONVERSION
1062130	If you have a static non-customizable house, it may be possible to convert it into a <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a>.  The following house types <B>cannot</B> be converted:  Castles, Keeps, Two-Story Wood and Plaster, and Two-Story Stone and Plaster.  All other house types can be converted.  When you convert a house into a dirt lot, the house vanishes and is replaced with a dirt lot exactly the same size as the original house.  This conversion is completely secure and automatic, so there is no risk of losing your house.  If you meet the <a href = "?139">restrictions</a> for owning a customizable dirt lot, you may perform the conversion using your house sign menu.<BR><BR>When you convert the house, you are refunded the original purchase price of the house, then charged the cost of the equivalent dirt lot.  In most cases, the original cost of a house is more than the cost of a dirt lot with the same footprint, meaning you will get a refund (which can be used towards customizing your lot).  Note that "original purchase price" refers to the cost of the deed used to place the house, or the cost listed on the House Placement Tool menu for the house, and <B>not</B> the amount the house was traded for in its last player-to-player trade.
1062131	HOUSE RESTRICTIONS
1062132	You are limited to owning one house on your account across all shards.  If you own a house on one shard, you cannot own a house on another shard.  If at any time you place a new house or receive a house in trade, your house will become condemned.  A condemned house will decay within 5 days.  The only way to un-condemn a house is to trade it to another player.  If you trade away your new house, this will <B>not</B> un-condemn your other house.<BR><BR>Whenever you place a house or receive on in trade with another player, you may not place another house or receive another house in trade for seven days, even if you demolish the house or trade it to another player.<BR><BR>In order to own a <a href = "?143?">customizable</a> house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online:  Age of Shadows</I>.  If your account is not upgraded, you cannot place a customizable <a href = "?144?">dirt lot</a>, nor can you receive a customizable house in trade.
1062133	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062134	Customizable houses have two modes: <a href = "?168">normal</a> and <a href = "?169">customization</a>.<BR><BR>When you enter Customization Mode, all of the house's contents are either ejected or packed into a <a href = "?170">Moving Crate</a>.  As you customize your house, no objects, players, or monsters can interact with you or the house.  You can leave customization mode by <a href = "?165">committing a new design</a>, or by <a href = "?164">saving your design for later</a>.  Committing a new design costs you money and requires you to manuall unpack the moving crate.  Saving a design for later restores the house to its former state.<BR><BR>Custom houses must obey certain <a href = "?163">structural support</a> rules.<BR><BR>While customizing a house, a special house building interface appears on your screen.  This interface has a multitude of options, listed here:<BR><BR><a href = "?157">Component Selection</a> (<a href = "?173">Walls</a>, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>)
1062135	COMPONENT MENU
1062136	The center area of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> is where you select components to paint onto your house design.  Most <a href = "?157">categories</a> of components have multiple pages of items to choose from.  The arrow icons on the left and right edges of this menu allow you to switch between pages of available components.  From this menu, click a component, and you will enter paint mode with the selected component active.<BR><BR>When entering the <a href = "?173">walls</a> or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> categories, this area first shows a one-page list of subcategories.  Click a subcategory to browse the individual sets of components in that category.  When browsing a subcategory, an upward pointing arrow icon here allows you to return to the category list.<BR><BR>When in the walls category, this menu has an extra button that toggles windows on and off.  If you wish to place walls with built-in windows, click the window toggle.<BR><BR>In the <a href = "?159">doors</a> category, icons next to each door show which way the door opens.
1062137	SYSTEM MENU
1062138	The system menu button in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> shows several icons that allow you to change house modes and access additional features.  The buttons are:<BR><BR><a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>.
1062139	SYNCH
1062140	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, network conditions may cause your client to lose synchronization with the server.  Use this <a href = "?147">system menu</a> button to force a re-synchronization.  This completely resets your client's view of your house design to match the one on the server.
1062141	CLEAR
1062142	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to simply erase your current design and start over.  Click the Clear button on the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> to erase your current design and start over with an empty dirt lot.  Note that this only clears your current in-progress design, and does not erase your active design or your <a href = "?150">saved</a> design.
1062143	BACKUP
1062144	Click the Backup button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to create a backup of your in-progress design.  Whenever you leave design mode without committing your new design, your in-progress design is automatically backedup.  Your house can only have one backed up design, so using this option overwrites your previous backup.  Use the <a href = "?151">restore</a> button to load your backed up design into your in-progress design.
1062145	RESTORE
1062146	Click the Restore button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to restore a previously <a href = "?150">backed up,</a> house design.  This does not affect your house's active design.
1062147	COMMIT
1062148	The Commit button is located in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  Click this button to finalize your in-progress design and make it your house's active design.  See <a href = "?165">committing a new house design</a> for more information.
1062149	REVERT
1062150	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to replace your in-progress house design</a> with your current active design.  This is much like <a href = "?151">restoring</a> a design, except you are loading the last design you <a href = "?152">committed</a> rather than the last design you <a href = "?150">backed up</a>.
1062151	EYEDROPPER
1062152	The eyedropper tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to instantly select a <a href = "?146">component</a> already in your house design.  Click the Eraser icon, and target the component to copy.  The component menu switches to the page where the selected component can be found, and your cursor switches to painting mode with that component active.
1062153	ERASER
1062154	The eraser tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to delete <a href = "?146">components</a> from your house design.  To erase components from your house design, click the Erase icon and target tiles to delete.  The tile to be deleted highlights red when your cursor is over it.  Click to erase the tile.  You cannot click and drag to delete multiple components.  You must single-click once for each tile to be deleted.
1062155	COMPONENT AND FIXTURE COUNTER
1062156	These numbers near the bottom of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> display the number of components and number of fixtures in your house design.  Hovering your mouse over this counter brings up a small window showing more details.<BR><BR>Each fixture also counts as a component.  Fixtures are components that are interactive, and currently include <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.  Fixtures also count towards your house secure storage limit.  The number of fixtures allowed in a house design is limited.
1062157	COMPONENT SELECTION
1062158	On the left side of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu are nine buttons organized in three rows of three.  The first two rows open lists of components you can paint onto your house design.  To choose a component to paint, click the desired category and then select a component from the <a href = "?146">component menu.<B><B>The available categories of components are: <a href = "?173">Walls, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>.
1062159	WALLS
1062160	<a href = "?146">Components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  They are organized according to how they should be positioned in your house.  Use the V-shaped corner piece when two walls should to the south and east.  The smallest pieces here are the corner posts that join walls to the north and west.  The remaining wall pieces are north and east facing walls.  With a little practice, you'll get a good feel for how these pieces connect together.  Walls must be <a href = "?163">structurally supported</a> and if they are full-height they can provide support for floor components above them.<BR><BR>You may use the window toggle at the top of the component menu to select walls with built-in windows to place in your house design.
1062161	FLOORS
1062162	Floor <a href = "?146">components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  Select the floor you wish to paint onto your house design.  If you wish to change floors that are hidden by walls, use the <a href = "?174">transparency buttons</a> to see behind them.  Floors provide <a href = "?163">structural support</a> for non-floor components positioned on top of them.
1062163	DOORS
1062164	Door <a href = "?146">components</a> are one type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  Simply choose the style of door from the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> you wish to paint on your house design.  Like <a href = "?173">walls</a>, doors require<a href = "?163"> structural support</a>, and can provide support for items above them.
1062165	STAIRS
1062166	Stair <a href = "?146">components</a> come in two types.  First are staircases, which serve to join different stories of your house.  The other type are front steps, which allow access to your foundation.  On the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> for the stairs category, staircases appear on the top row and front step components appear on the bottom row.<BR><BR>Staircases are multiple-tile components that have special properties.  They must have sufficient <a href = "?163">structural support</a>.  Furthermore, you cannot place <a href = "?158">floors</a> in the spaces above a staircase, because those floors would block movement up the staircase.<BR><BR>Front steps can only be placed along the south edge of your house's foundation.  Note that the house customization system will allow you to <a href = "?155">erase</a> all of your front steps.  If you do this, it will be impossible for anyone (including you) to enter your custom house.  Be careful to always create a way to get onto your house!
1062167	TELEPORTERS
1062168	Teleporter <a href = "?146">components</a> are a type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  They are similar in most respects to <a href = "?158">floor</a> components, except that they provide an alternative means to move around in your custom house.<BR><BR>In order for a teleporter to be functional, it must link to one or more other teleporters.  Each teleporter component has a different symbol engraved in it.  To link teleporters, place multiple teleporters of the same symbol.  When you <a href = "?152">commit</a> your design, teleporters with matching symbols link up.<BR><BR>Stepping on one linked teleporter will move your avatar to another teleporter tile with the same symbol.  If there are only two teleporters in your house with the same symbol, stepping on one will always move you to the other.  If three or more teleporters share the same symbol, stepping on one will move you to one of the others with the same symbol, selected randomly.
1062169	MISCELLANEOUS
1062170	The miscellaneous <a href = "?146">component</a> category contains a selection of different tiles, including archways, battlements, columns, fences, and waterfalls.  Like most other components, these require <a href = "?163">structural support</a> and can provide structural support to other components.
1062171	TRANSPARENCY SELECTION
1062172	These controls allow you to change the visibility of walls and floors on different stories of the house, to make it easer to design around them.  Each of the buttons in this column correspond to one story of your house.  Each time you click the button, transparency settings move to the next setting in the cycle.  When you <a href = "?175">change stories</a>, all transparency settings are reset on all storied.
1062173	STORY SELECTION
1062174	To edit a different story of your house, use the buttons in the rightmost column on your house customization interface.  Each button corresponds to one story of your house.  Simply click a button to be transported to that story.  When you do this, <a href = "?174">transparency settings</a> for all stories are reset.
1062175	STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
1062176	Your custom house design must (to a certain degree) obey the laws of physics.  This means that you can't have floors floating on air and hovering columns.  Every <a href = "?146">component</a> in your house must be structurally supported.  Most components provide some form of structural support to other components.<BR><BR>Here is how it works:  There are two main types of structural support:  floors and walls.  Any tile in your house design that does not have valid structural support highlights orange.  You cannot <a href = "?165">commit</a> your house design while any tiles in it are not validly supported.<BR><BR><a href = "?158">Floor (and <a href = "?161">teleporter</a>) tiles must be supported by non-floor components on the story below.  Floor tiles on the first story of your house are considered supported by the foundation below them.  Any <a href = "?173">wall</a>, <a href = "?159">door</a>, or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> component that is the full height of one story of your house can provide structural support for floor components above them.  Any floor tile directly on top of a supporting component is itself considered supported.  Any floor tile adjacent to a directly supported floor tile is also supported.  If you build a solid line of floor tiles between two directly supported tiles, all tiles in that line are validly supported.  Whenever you form a rectangle of supported floor tiles, all floor tiles in that rectangle are validly supported.<BR><BR>Non-floor components must obtain their structural support either from validly supported floors, or from adjacent non-floor items.  Any component that touches the ground can receive its support from a floor tile.  Some components (like parts of archways) do not touch the ground, and can only receive support from an adjacent component that is tall enough.  There is a limit to how far pieces can receive adjacent support.
1062177	SAVING A DESIGN
1062178	If you are not ready to <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, you can save it for later.  To do this, simply right-click the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  You will exit <a href = "?169">customization mode</a> and you can come back and work on your design again later.
1062179	COMMITTING A NEW HOUSE DESIGN
1062180	Once you are completed re-designing your house, you are ready to commit the design.  In order to do so, you must have funds in your bank (in the form of gold and/or checks) to cover the <a href = "?167">cost</a> of your new design.  (Note that if your new design has fewer components in it, you may receive a refund.)  Simply open the <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> in the <a href = "?145">house customization interface</a> and choose the <a href = "?XXX">Commit</a> option.  Once your confirm, your house will change to your new design.  Once you do this, you must check over the security settings on all your <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.
1062181	HOUSE VALUE
1062182	Non-customizable houses have fixed costs.  The cost to place each house type is displayed on the house placement tool menu.  If you demolish a non-customizable house or covert it into a customizable one, you are refunded 90% of this amount (also referred to as the house value).
1062183	CUSTOMIZATION COSTS
1062184	The cost to commit a house design is based on the number of components in the house, including the foundation itself.  The current cost of a house is displayed in the lower-right corner of the house design menu.  When committing a new design, you are refunded 90% of the value of the old design and must pay the cost displayed.
1062185	NORMAL MODE
1062186	In normal mode, customizable houses behave just like any other house -- you can walk around on them or in them, store objects inside, and so forth.  See also:  <a href = "?169">customization mode</a>.
1062187	CUSTOMIZATION MODE
1062188	In Customization Mode, all access to the house is blocked except to the person customizing the house.  In this mode, all other players see the house as it was prior to entering customization mode, but hey cannot enter it or interact with it in any way.  The player actually customizing the house, however, can see and edit a new in-progress design.  When you are customizing a house, you are invisible and safe from attack.  You can walk through the walls of your house and walk on air without falling.  This allows you to change your house design conveniently and in perfect safety.  Note, however, that you cannot do anything else at all in this mode.  While customizing your house, you cannot open your backpack, use any objects, use any skills, speak to other players, or leave the house.  It is much like being a ghost.  See also: <a href = "?168">normal mode</a>.
1062189	MOVING CRATE
1062190	The house moving crate is a special container that holds your locked down items, secure containers, vendors, barkeepers, and house add-ons while you edit your house.  When you enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a>, your items are packed into the moving crate, which is hidden from view.<BR><BR>If you leave customization mode without committing a new design, your items are automatically unpacked from the moving mrate and restored to their previous position.  The only exception is house add-ons, which remain in deed form inside the moving crate.  You must manually replace these.<BR><BR>When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new design, items cannot be automatically unpacked from the moving crate.  You must instead <a href = "?171">unpack</a> these items yourself.
1062191	UNPACKING
1062192	When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, items inside your <a href = "?170">moving crate</a> remain inside and hidden.  You must remove these items and position them in your house.  Vendors and barkeeps require <a href = "?172">special handling</a>.<BR><BR>The moving crate cannot be picked up, and you cannot put items inside.  Once you remove an item from the crate, you cannot put it back in.  Items inside the crate count toward your secure storage limit.  Items inside your moving crate are organized into sub-containers.<BR><BR>You can teleport your moving crate to the spot where you are standing at any time by opening your house sign menu, going to the CUSTOMIZATION page, and choosing <B>Relocate Moving Crate</B>.
1062193	UNPACKING VENDORS AND BARKEEPS
1062194	Vendors and barkeepers are invisible when they are inside a <a href = "?170">moving crate</a>.  In order to put them back to work, you must move to the desired location in your house.  Next, open the context-sensitive menu on your avatar and choose the Station Vendor option.  A menu listing all your vendors and barkeeps by name appears.  Select one.  If the place you are standing on is valid, the vendor or barkeep appears there and returns to work.

1062196	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062197	This feature allows you to create a truly unique home by laying out the floor plan and choosing building materials for the walls, floors, and other components.  In order to build or own a custom house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online: Age of Shadows</I>.  Not all houses are customizable.  In order to build your own house, you need to obtain a customizable <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a> and sufficient <a href = "?167">funds</a> to pay for the customization.  Using your house sign, you will enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a> and edit your house's design.  When you are ready, you can <a href = "?165">commit</a> your new design, making it visible for all the world to see.
1062198	DIRT LOTS
1062199	Dirt lots are a special type of house that can be <a href = "?143">customized</a>.  They are in most respects exactly like normal houses, except that only players who have upgraded to Ultima Online: Age of Shadows can own them.  There are three ways to obtain a dirt lot:  by <a href = "?135">placing</a> one, by <a href = "?140">buying</a> one, or by <a href = "?141">converting</a> a house into one.
1062200	A personal bless deed has been placed in your backpack.
1062201	Only the owner, ~1_NAME~, can use this deed.
1062202	This deed allows you to bless an item.  The blessed item cannot be stolen from this character, and will remain with this character when death occurs.  The blessed effects of the item WILL NOT work for any other character, including other characters on your account.
1062203	Blessed for ~1_NAME~
1062204	You personally bless the item for this character.
1062205	Unfortunately you are playing on a *NON-Age-Of-Shadows* game installation and cannot be transported to Malas.  You will not be able to take your new player quest in Malas without an AOS client.  You are now being taken to the city of Haven on the Trammel facet.
1062206	You cannot do that while customizing a house.
1062207	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Condemned</a>.
1062208	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Grandfathered</a>.
1062209	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Automatically</a> refreshed.

1062786	Thank you for participating in the character transfer program. In order to continue, you must indicate your understanding of the character transfer process by clicking the "Next" button. Complete details on this process can be found by pointing your Web browser at <a href="http://support.uo.com/charactertransfer.html">support.uo.com/charactertransfer.html</a>, but we would like to call special attention to the following points:<br>- Items eligible for transfer include your character, everything your character has equipped (both wearing and holding), your backpack, your bank box, all your stabled pets, all your character's pets within the immediate vicinity, and their associated contents. (Temporary "followers," such as hirelings, escorts, and animated dead, will not be transferred.)<br>- Please verify the contents of your character's "transfer crate" are correct before initiating the transfer to the new shard. You will not get another opportunity to do so, nor can items be added if you find them missing afterwards.<br>- Houses and their secured items will not be transferred.<br>- You will lose all affiliations to guilds, factions, and parties once the transfer is complete.<br>- Bracelets of Binding and Balls of Pet Summoning will have their links cleared upon transfer to the new shard.<br>- All legacy "house deeds" will be converted into house placement tools.<br>- You can cancel transfer at any point during the process, and resume at a later date.<br>- You will not be able to log into the original or destination shards until the transfer is complete.<br>- You will have to recreate any custom game macros for that character after the transfer to the new shard.<br>- After entering the new shard, <i>you will have 7 days to remove all items from your character's "transfer crate." </i>Any items that remain in the crate after that time will disappear forever. (You can access your transfer crate at any time by choosing the "Open Transfer Crate" option from the context menu on your character.)

1062911	Royal Leggings of Embers
1062912	<body>When Britannia was founded, the king was attacked with a fire spell that nearly killed him. (Rumors of his demise were highly exaggerated.) Ever since, he kept a pair of Royal Leggings of Embers nearby.</body>
1062913	Rose of Trinsic
1062914	<body>In the second age of Britannia, the peaceful town of Trinsic was attacked by the forces of chaos. After a fierce, bloody battle, the town was overrun and destroyed. This rose commemorates the Honor of the Trinsic defenders.</body>
1062915	Shamino’s Best Crossbow
1062916	<body>Once a king of Sosaria, Shamino was one of Lord British’s greatest Companions. Hailing from the city of Skara Brae, known for its spiritual people, Shamino followed the life of a ranger and was perhaps the best marksman in the land. This crossbow design is one created especially for him by Iolo, his long-time companion.</body>
1062917	The Tapestry of Sosaria
1062918	<body>The history of the world is recorded in this tapestry, starting with the first days of Britannia to Third Dawn’s age of prosperity and opportunity. It was designed by one of Lord British’s most loyal companions, Iolo, a master bard and storyteller.</body>
1062919	Hearth of the Home Fire
1062920	<body>When Lord Blackthorn waged a dark campaign to steal control of Britannia, the citizens often stayed home at night, not daring to leave their homes. The good people of Britannia spent those cold nights huddled around the warmth of a blazing fireplace like this one.</body>
1062921	The Holy Sword
1062922	<body>The fifth age, known as the Age of Shadows, was a difficult one. Necromancers had learned to raise the dead from their graves, and holy Knights joined ranks to wipe the dark art of Necromancy from the world. It is a struggle that still continues. Knights, thanks to a blacksmith with arcane knowledge, now have the Holy Sword to help in their quest.</body>
1062923	Ancient Samurai Helm
1062924	<body>Strange items from a strange land are being found. Rumors abound of a new land with new warriors and new ways to wage war. If the rumors are true, Britannia might never be the same. This strange helm was brought back on a trade vessel. Its exotic beauty pales in the face of its durability.</body>

1063028	<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time while you are here. Simply return to Daimyo Haochi and speak with him. Once you travel to the city, you will not be able to return. <BR><BR>
1063029	Greetings. I am Daimyo Haochi, the Feudal Lord of this region. <BR><BR>Since you are here at my side, you must wish to learn the ways of the Samurai.<BR><BR> Wielding a blade is easy, anyone can grasp a sword’s hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman.<BR><BR> Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here. <BR><BR>You will go through 7 trials to prove your adherence to the Samurai code. <BR><BR> The first trial will test your decision making skills. You only have to enter the area beyond the green passageway. <BR><BR>Do not attempt to hurry your trials. The guards will only let you through to each trial when I have deemed you ready.<br><br>As a last resort you may use the golden teleporter tiles in each trial area but do so at your own risk. You may not be able to return and complete your trials once you have chosen to escape.
1063030	Follow the green path. The guards will now let you through.
1063031	Beyond you are two troubled groups.<BR><BR> The Cursed Souls were once proud warriors that were ensorcelled by an evil mage. The mage trapped and killed them later but the spell has not lifted from their souls in death. <BR><BR>The Young Ronin were former Samurai in training who lost their way. They are loyal only to those with enough coin in their pocket. <BR><BR>You must decide who needs to be fought to the death. You may wish to <a href="?ForceTopic27">review combat techniques</a> as well as <a href = "?ForceTopic29">information on healing yourself</a>. <BR><BR>Return to Daimyo Haochi after you have finished with your trial.<br><br>If you should die during any of your trials, visit one of the Ankh Shrines and you will be resurrected. You should retrieve your belongings from your body before returning to the Daimyo or you may not be able to return to your corpse.
1063032	Kill 3 Young Ronin or 3 Cursed Souls. Return to Daimyo Haochi when you have finished.
1063033	To view the surrounding area, you should learn about the Radar Map.<BR><BR>The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.<BR><BR>Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little. Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
1063034	You are already in a guild!
1063035	Abbreviation:
1063036	A guild name cannot be more than ~1_val~ characters in length.
1063037	An abbreviation cannot exceed ~1_val~ characters in length.
1063038	Cursed Souls killed:  ~1_COUNT~
1063039	Young Ronin killed:  ~1_COUNT~
1063040	You have just gained some <a href="?ForceTopic45">Karma</a> for killing a Cursed Soul.
1063041	You have just gained some <a href="?ForceTopic45">Karma</a> for killing a Young Ronin.
1063042	Continue slaying the Cursed Souls!
1063043	Continue slaying the Young Ronin!
1063044	The first trial is complete. Return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063045	It is good that you rid the land of the Cursed Souls so they can be at peace in death. They had been cursed for doing what they thought was an honorable deed. Now they can have respect in their death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack. <BR><BR>The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.
1063046	It is good that you rid the land of those dishonorable Samurai. Perhaps they will learn a greater lesson in death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack.<BR><BR> The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.
1063047	Follow the yellow path. The guards will now let you through.
1063048	Whom do you wish to invite into your guild?
1063049	~1_val~ is not accepting guild invitations.
1063050	~1_val~ is already a member of your guild!
1063051	~1_val~ is already a member of a guild.
1063052	~1_val~ is currently considering another guild invitation.
1063053	You invite ~1_val~ to join your guild.
1063054	You fail to join.
1063055	You are now ignoring guild invitations.
1063056	You have joined ~1_val~.
1063057	Beyond the guards is a test of courage.  You must face your fear and attack a great beast. You must choose which beast to slay for there is more than one beyond the courtyard doors. <BR><BR>The imp entered the courtyard unaware of its surroundings. The dragon came knowingly, hunting for the flesh of humans – A feast for the beast. <BR><BR>You must rid the courtyard of these beasts but you may only choose one to attack. Go and choose wisely.
1063058	Choose your opponent and attack one with all your skill.
1063059	Fear remains in your eyes but you have learned that not all is what it appears to be. <BR><BR>You must have known the dragon would slay you instantly. You elected the weaker opponent though the imp did not come here to destroy. You have much to learn. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path.
1063060	You faced the dragon knowing it would be your certain death. That is the courage of a Samurai. <BR><BR>Your spirit speaks as a Samurai already. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path.
1063061	The next trial will test your benevolence. Follow the blue path. The guards will now let you through.
1063062	A pack of wolves circle your feet. They have been injured and are in pain. A quick death will end their suffering.<br><br>Use your Honorable Execution skill or other means to finish off a wounded wolf. Do so and return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063063	Use your Honorable Execution skill to finish off the wounded wolf. Double click the icon in your Book of Bushido to activate the skill. When you are done, return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063064	Return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063065	<I>Daimyo Haochi smiles as you walk up to him. Quietly he says:</I><BR><BR> A Samurai understands the need to help others even as he wields a blade against them. <BR><BR>You have shown compassion. A true Samurai is benevolent even to an enemy. For this you have been rewarded. <BR><BR>And now you must prove yourself again. Walk the red path.  We will talk again later.
1063066	Follow the red path and pass through the guards to the entrance of the fourth trial.
1063067	<I>You approach a disheveled gypsy standing near a small shed. You sense that she has not eaten nor bathed in quite some time. <BR><BR>Around her is a large colony of mangy and diseased cats. It appears she has spent what little money she’s earned to feed the cats instead of herself. <BR><BR>You have a decision to make. You can give her gold so she can buy some food for her animals and herself. You can also remove the necessity of the extra mouths to feed so she may concentrate on saving herself.</i><br><br>If you elect to give the gypsy money, you can do so by clicking your stack of gold and selecting ‘1’. Then dragging it and dropping it on the Gypsy.
1063068	Give the gypsy gold or hunt one of the cats to eliminate the undue need it has placed on the gypsy.
1063069	The wolves no longer need your assistance.
1063070	You showed respect by helping another out while allowing the gypsy what little dignity she has left. <BR><BR>Now she will be able to feed herself and gain enough energy to walk to her camp. <BR><BR>The cats are her family members– cursed by an evil mage. <BR><BR>Once she has enough strength to walk back to the camp, she will be able to undo the spell. <BR><BR>You have been rewarded for completing your trial. And now you must prove yourself again. <BR><BR>Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.
1063071	Respect comes from allowing another to make their own decisions. By denying the gypsy her animals, you negate the respect she is due. Perhaps you will have learned something to use next time a similar situation arises. <BR><BR> And now you must prove yourself again. Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.
1063072	Retrieve Daimyo Haochi’s katana from the treasure room.
1063073	Give the sword to Daimyo Haochi.

1063075	I saw you drop the sword earlier. Take care not to lose it this time.
1063076	Thank you for returning this sword to me and leaving the remaining treasure alone. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete.

1063077	I thank you for returning this sword. However, you should admonished for also taking treasure that was not asked for nor given back.  <BR><BR>Think about your actions youngling. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete.

1063078	Light one of the candles near the altar and return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063079	You have done well young Samurai. There is but one thing left to do. <BR><BR>In the final room is the holding cell containing young Ninjas who came to take my life. They were caught and placed in my custody. <BR><BR>Take care of these miscreants and show them where your loyalty lies. <BR><BR>This is your final act as a Samurai in training.
1063080	Three young Ninja must be dealt with. Your job is to kill them. When you have done so, return to Daimyo Haochi.

1063175	Ah, another fledgling unfurls its wings. Welcome to my home young one. <BR><BR>I am Daimyo Emino, a passionate collector of sorts. One who is vengeful towards those impeding my reign. <BR><BR>You have the look of someone who could help me but your skills are untested. Are you willing to prove your mettle as my hireling? <BR><BR>Elite Ninja Zoel awaits you in the backyard. He will lead you to the first trial. You will be directed further when you arrive at your destination. You should speak to him before exploring the yard or cave entrance.
1063176	Find Elite Ninja Zoel immediately!
1063177	<I>Zoel studies your face as you approach him. Wryly, he says:</I><BR><BR> Daimyo Emino has sent another already? The stains from the last have not yet dried! <BR><BR>No matter, we’ll finish you off and clean it all at once, eh? <BR><BR>Now to the point, your only task is to survive in the abandoned inn.<BR><BR>You will be instructed when you need to act and when you should return to one of us. <BR><BR>Only a true Ninja is deft enough to finish and remain alive.<BR><BR>Your future... or your demise... lies in this cave beyond. <BR><BR>Now go.
1063178	Potion of Escape
1063179	Enter the cave and walk through it. You will be tested as you travel along the path.
1063180	A glowing archway stands before you. <BR><BR>To either side of its frame are mounted demon heads, breathing fire and watching your every move. <BR><BR>To pass through, you must first vanish from the demons’ sight. Only then can you slowly traverse the entryway.
1063181	You’ll need to hide in order to pass through the door. <BR><BR>To find out how to use active skills, visit the <a href = "?ForceTopic73">Codex of Wisdom</a>. To activate a skill, locate it on your skills list and click the blue button located to the left of the skill's name.<br><br>Once you have successfully hidden, you may move slowly through the door.
1063182	Through the door lies a short passageway. The path ends abruptly at a strange tile on the floor.  The special tile is known as a teleporter.  Step on the teleporter tile and you will be transported to a new location.
1063183	The special tile is known as a teleporter. Step on the teleporter tile and you will be transported to a new location.
1063184	<I>Daimyo Emino smiles as you approach him:</I> <BR><BR>I see that you have survived both the first trial and Zoel’s temper. <BR><BR>For that you have been rewarded with Leggings and Gloves befitting your occupation. The material is the only armor a <b><I>True Ninja</i></b> needs. <BR><BR>You have yet to prove yourself fully, young hireling. Another trial must be met. Off to Zoel you go. Bring him this note so he knows we have spoken.
1063185	Bring the note to Elite Ninja Zoel and speak with him again. He is near the cave entrance. You can hand the note to Zoel by dragging it and dropping it on his body.
1063186	A Note for Zoel
1063187	You have lost my note? I will scribe another for you. Try not to lose this one.
1063188	You decide against dropping this important note.
1063189	<I>Zoel quickly grabs the scroll from your hand and reads the note:</i> <BR><BR>Still alive then? You’ll have to impress me further before I will give my approval of you to Daimyo Emino. <BR><BR>You must return to the inn and begin the next trial. <BR><BR>We believe an associate has, shall we say, inadvertently negated our contract. <BR><BR>Find out what information you can and return to Daimyo Emino with the news. And be careful not to lose your head.<BR><BR>The Blue Teleporter Tile in Daimyo Emino’s residence will lead you to your fate. I suggest you hurry. <BR><BR>...And take care to tread softly. There is no greater traitor than a heavy footfall upon a path.
1063190	Take the Blue Teleporter Tile from Daimyo Emino's house to the Abandoned Inn. Quietly look around to gain information.
1063191	They won’t find me here.
1063192	Ah, a quiet hideout.
1063193	I wonder if I can find a sharpening stone around here.
1063194	Who locked me in this room?
1063195	Must have been strong ale to land me in this place.
1063196	You quietly approach the door and see a woman named Jedah Entille speaking to a shady figure in dark clothing. You move closer so you can overhear the conversation. Fortunately, your entrance did not alert the preoccupied party. <BR><BR>Jedah’s brash voice permeates the air:<I><BR><BR> Now that it is hidden, we’ll hide out here until Daimyo Emino forgets about us. Once he realizes his beloved sword is missing, he’ll surely start looking for the thieves. We will be long gone by that time. </I><BR><BR>After overhearing the conversation, you understand why you were sent on this trial. You must immediately tell Daimyo Emino what you have learned.
1063197	Go back through the blue teleporter and tell Daimyo Emino what you’ve overheard.
1063198	You stand on the strange floor tile but nothing happens.
1063199	<I>Daimyo Emino frowns as you relay the information. He pauses for a moment before speaking to you:</i> <BR><BR>Jedah was once one of my most promising students, but her greed will be her downfall. <BR><BR>I will send one of my disciples to deal with her later. It is more important to get that sword back first. <BR><BR>I’m counting on you to find it. She would have kept it close to her. Take the White Teleporter, located in my backyard, and check inside boxes and chests around the treasure room of the inn and return it to me when you find it.<BR><BR>Be very careful. Jedah was an expert with traps and no doubt she’s protecting the sword with them. <BR><BR>If you find a trap, try timing it and you may be able to avoid damage. <BR><BR>I’ve provided you with several heal potions in case you become injured. <BR><BR>In the bag you will also find more clothing appropriate to your new found profession. <BR><BR>Please return the sword to me. I implore you not to take anything else that may be hidden in the Inn. <BR><BR>Thank you.
1063200	Take the white teleporter and check the chests for the sword. Leave everything else behind. Avoid damage from traps you may encounter. To use a potion, make sure at least one hand is free and double click on the bottle.
1063201	A narrow hallway greets the teleporter. The enclosed space is the perfect setting for dangerous traps. Walk through the hallway being careful to avoid the traps. You may be able to time the traps to avoid injury.
1063202	Walk through the hallway being careful to avoid the traps. You may be able to time the traps to avoid injury.
1063203	The lid of the chest refuses to budge at first, but slowly you are able to pry the lid open. <BR><BR>Inside lies the sword you have been in search of.  You quickly take the sword and stash it in your backpack.  Bring the sword back to Daimyo Emino.
1063204	Take the sword and bring it back to Daimyo Emino.
1063205	Screams echo through the chamber as you walk away from the chest. Jedah’s Henchmen have become cognizant of your presence. <BR><BR>It is time for your Ninja Spirit to come alive. Slay 3 of the Henchmen before returning to Daimyo Emino.
1063206	Kill three henchmen.
1063207	Henchmen killed:
1063208	Continue killing the henchmen!
1063209	You have not completed your duties.
1063210	You have proven your fighting skills. Bring the Sword to Daimyo Emino immediately. Be sure to follow the path back to the teleporter.
1063211	Go to Daimyo Emino. Go back through the chamber the way you came.<BR><BR> Give Daimyo Emino the sword when you've returned to his side.
1063212	What? You have returned without the sword? You need to go back and get it again!

1071221	Oh, I beg your pardon! I am Lyla, assistant to the Zoologist Iakas. I'm searching for samples from the gelatinous family of slimes - such an amazing species! - for him. They have some monetary value as well, as they excrete a pigment that can be used as a dye. Yet I can't even seem to catch one! They're moving so... well, I've never seen anything like it. If you think you can do better, would you collect three samples and deliver them to Iakas as the Royal Britannian Zoo? Use these basins - they can hold the slime safely.

When the caster invokes this spell, a magically charged emerald (called an arcane focus) is created for the caster and each participating arcanist. The arcane focus increases duration, spell damage, healing spell effectiveness, and area of effect for the activator’s Spellweaving spells.
1072043	The arcanist taps into the regenerative forces of nature to deliver healing pulses for the duration of the spell.
1072044	Temporarily enchants a melee weapon to inflict extra fire damage per hit.

1072054	Allows the arcanist to wander around in an ethereal form as if under the effects of monster ignore.  Effect ends after the duration expires or when the caster performs a hostile action (whichever comes first).

1072254	You there! Yes, you.  Listen, I've got a little problem on my hands, but a brave, bold hero like yourself should find it a snap to solve.  Bottom line -- we need some of the bulls in the area culled.  You're welcome to any meat or hides, and of course, I'll give you a nice reward.
1072255	Human
1072256	Elf
1072257	Are you new around here?  Well, nevermind that.  You look ready for adventure, I can see the gleam of glory in your eyes!  Nothing is more valiant, more noble, more praiseworthy than mongbat slaying.
1072258	You failed to complete an objective in time!
1072259	Aaaahhhh!  They're everywhere!  Aaaaahhh!  Ahem.  Actually, friend, how do you feel about rabbits?  Well, we're being overrun by them.  We're finding fuzzy bunnies everywhere. Aaaaahhh!
1072260	A pity really.  With the balance of nature awry, we have no choice but to accept the responsibility of making it all right.  It's all a part of the circle of life, after all. So, yes, the boars are running rampant. There are far too many in the region.  Will you shoulder your obligations as a higher life form?
1072261	Mmm, I do love mutton!  It's slaughtering time again and my usual hirelings haven't turned up.  I've arranged for a butcher to come by and cut everything up but the basic sheep killing part I haven't gotten worked out yet.  Are you up for the task?
1072262	Pork is the fruit of the land!  You can barbeque it, boil it, bake it, sautee it.  There's pork kebabs, pork creole, pork gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried.  There's apple pork, peppered pork, pork soup, pork salad, pork and potatoes, pork burger, pork sandwich, pork stew, pork chops, pork loins, shredded pork.  So, let's get some piggies butchered!
1072263	Psst!  Hey ... psst!  Listen, I need some help here but it's gotta be hush hush.  I don't want THEM to know I'm onto them.  They watch me.  I've seen them, but they don't know that I know what I know.  You know?  Anyway, I need you to scare them off by killing a few of them.  That'll send a clear message that I won't suffer goats watching me!
1072264	Chirp chirp ... tweet chirp.  Tra la la.  Bloody birds and their blasted noise.  I've tried everything but they just won't stop that infernal clamor.  Return me to blessed silence and I'll make it worth your while.
1072265	Mighty creatures they are, aye.  Fierce and strong, can't blame 'em for wanting to feed themselves an' all.  Blame or no, they're eating all the fish up, so they got to go.  Lend a hand?
1072266	An arrow imbeds itself into your flesh!
1072267	I just can't bear it any longer.  Sure, it's my job to thin the deer out so they don't overeat the area and starve themselves come winter time.  Sure, I know we killed off the predators that would do this naturally so now we have to make up for it.  But they're so graceful and innocent.  I just can't do it.  Will you?
1072268	A small bag of trinkets.
1072269	Quest Giver
1072270	Well, okay. But if you decide you are up for it after all, c'mon back and see me.
1072271	You're not quite done yet.  Get back to work!
1072272	Thanks for helping me out.  Here's the reward I promised you.
1072273	You've completed a quest!  Don't forget to collect your reward.

1072571	Fine. It's no skin off my teeth.
1072572	Small words.  Kill Moug-Guur.  Go.  Now!
1072573	You're better than I thought you'd be.  Not particularly bad, but not entirely inept.
1072574	Well now that Moug-Guur is no more -- and I can't say I'm weeping for his demise -- it's time for the ratmen to experience a similar loss of leadership.  Slay Chiikkaha.  In return, I'll satisfy your greed temporarily.
1072575	Alright, if you'd rather not, then run along and do whatever worthless things you do when I'm not giving you direction.
1072576	How difficult is this?  The rats live in the tunnels.  Go into the tunnels and find the biggest, meanest rat and execute him.  Loitering around here won't get the task done.
1072577	It's about time!  Could you have taken longer?
1072578	Hmm, maybe you aren't entirely worthless.  I suspect a demoness of Szavetra's calibre will tear you apart ...  We might as well find out.  Kill the succubus, yada yada, and you'll be richly rewarded.
1072579	Hah!  I knew you couldn't handle it.
1072580	TEMP: You have cast Ethereal Voyage.
1072581	Hahahaha!  I can see the fear in your eyes.  Pathetic.  Szavetra is waiting for you.
1072582	Amazing!  Simply astonishing ... you survived.  Well, I supposed I should indulge your avarice with a reward.

1072585	*looks around nervously*  Do you travel to The Heartwood?  I have an urgent letter that must be delivered there in the next 30 minutes -- to Ahie the Cloth Weaver.  Will you undertake this journey?
1072586	You cannot cast Ethereal Voyage while you are in combat.
1072587	*looks disappointed* Let me know if you change your mind.
1072588	You haven't lost the letter have you?  It must be delivered to Ahie directly.  Give it into no other hands.
1072589	The battered, old bucket is inscribed with barely legible writing that indicates it belongs to someone named "Dallid".  Maybe they'd pay for its return?
1072590	You're right, who cares if Dallid might pay for his battered old bucket back.  This way you can carry it around with you!
1072591	Whoever this "Dallid" might be, he's probably looking for his bucket.
1072592	You are very kind.  Thank you.
1072593	Those gargoyles need to get knocked down a peg or two, if you ask me.  They're always flying over here and lobbing things at us.  What a nuisance.  Drop a dozen of them for me, would you?
1072594	Don't tell me you're a gargoyle sympathizer?  *spits*
1072595	Those blasted gargoyles hang around the old tower.  That's the best place to hunt them down.

1072683	~1_NAME~ has already activated the Prism, please wait...
1072684	I understand.  The stench in those tunnels is unbearable.
1072685	The ratmen have holes all over the place that lead to their warrens.  Sometimes they're loitering around on the surface too.  Either way, they're not hard to find.
1072686	What a miserable place we live in.  Look around you at the changes we've wrought. The trees are sprouting leaves once more and the grass is reclaiming the blood-soaked soil.  Who would have imagined we'd find ourselves here?  Our "neighbors" are anything but friendly and those ogres are the worst of the lot.  Maybe you'd be interested in helping our community by disposing of some of our least amiable neighbors?
1072687	I quite understand your reluctance.  If you reconsider, I'll be here.
1072688	You can't miss those ogres, they're huge and just outside the gates here.

1072697	When you were exterminating those untidy vermin, you must have noticed the archers amongst them?  Those cowardly rats have been peppering us with arrows and then running away before we can retaliate.  Can I count on you to handle this for me?
1072698	Argh!  I knew those ratmen were up to no good!  They have stolen the ring I was making for my beloved Ciala.  The sparkle must have caught their greedy eyes.  Find the ring please!  I beg you.
1072699	Please, I beg of you, reconsider!
1072700	The stolen ring is easy enough to recognize.  It has an inscription on it declaring my love for Ciala.  Please find this token of love for me!
1072701	Ah my friend, thank you again for your timely aid!  The ring is finally complete and I'm ready to reveal to Ciala my love for her.  Would you ... could you present her with my token?
1072702	I know that this is a lot to ask.  Thank you for hearing my request.

1072707	*sigh*  We have so much to do to clean this area up.  Even the fine work you did on those ogres didn't have much of an impact on the community.  It's the ogre lords that direct the actions of the other ogres, let's strike at the leaders and perhaps that will thwart the miserable curs.
1072708	Reluctance doesn't become a hero like you.  But, as you wish.
1072709	Ogre Lords are pretty easy to recognize.  They're the ones ordering the other ogres about in a lordly manner.  Striking down their leadership will throw the ogres into confusion and dismay!
1072710	Inconceiveable!  We've learned that the ogre leadership has recruited some heavy-duty guards to their cause.  I've never personally fought a cyclopian warrior, but I'm sure you could easily best a few and report back how much trouble they'll cause to our growing community?
1072711	Oh, I see.  *sigh*  Perhaps I overestimated your abilities.
1072712	Make sure you fully assess all of the cyclopian tactical abilities!
1072713	The ogre insurgency has taken a turn for the worse!  I've just been advised that the titans have concluded their discussions with the ogres and they've allied.  We have virtually no information about titans.  Engage them and appraise their mettle.
1072714	Certainly.  You've done enough to merit a breather.  When you're ready for more, report back to me.
1072715	Those titans don't skulk very well.  You should be able to track them easily ... their footsteps are easily the largest around.

1072720	Shhh!  *angry whisper*  This is a library, not some bawdy house!  If you wish to become a friend of the library you'll learn to moderate your volume.  And, of course, you'll take this application and have it notarized by Sarakki the Notary.  Until you've become an official friend of the library, I can't allow you to make donations.  It wouldn't be proper.
1072721	Hrmph!
1072722	*glare*  Shhhh!  You need to visit the notary.  She can be found near the castle.
1072723	Access to the Stacks
1072724	What do you have there?  Oh.  *look of dismay*  It seems everyone is interested in helping the library -- but no one warned me to stock up on sealing wax.  I'm afraid I'm out of the mixture we use to notarize offical documents.  There will be a delay ... unless you'd like to take matters into your own hands and retrieve more for me from Petrus?
1072725	I do apologize for being unprepared. Perhaps when you return later I'll have more wax in stock.
1072726	Petrus lives in Ilshenar, past the Compassion gate and beyond the gypsy camp.
1072727	What's this?  Sealing wax ... Sarakki ... official documents ... Oh, I see.  Can do, can do.  You will need to get me the poison sacs of course.  They are so volatile they aren't viable after an hour or so ... yes, yes.  Right, well off you go, speckled scorpions are the only critters that have the right poison.  They live in the desert near here.
1072728	I see. I see.  Well good luck to you.
1072729	Hello, hello!  Speckled, that's what they are.  All covered with spots and speckles when you look very closely.  Speckled scorpion poison sacs will do the trick.

1072748	There you are!  *pleased smile*  Don't you just love when a form is all filled in like that?  All of the sections are complete, everything is neat and tidy and the official seal is perfectly formed and in exactly the right spot.  It's comforting.  Here you are.

They do not comprehend the lessons nor the dedication required.  If you would walk the path of the Arcanist, then you must do as I require without hesitation or question.  Your first task is to rid our home of rats ... 50 of them in the next hour.

They do not comprehend the lessons nor the dedication required.  If you would walk the path of the Arcanist, then you must do as I require without hesitation or question.  Your first task is to gather miniature mushrooms ... 20 of them from the branches of our mighty home.  I give you one hour to complete the task.
1072763	The way of the Arcanist involves cooperation with others and a strong committment to the community of your people.  We have run low on the cotton we use to pack wounds and our people have need.  Bring 10 bales of cotton to me.
1072764	We must look to the defense of our people!  Bring boards for new arrows.
1072765	With health and defense assured, we need look to the need of the community for food and drink.  We will feast on fish steaks, sweets, and wine.  You will supply the ingredients, the cooks will prepare the meal.  As a Arcanist relies upon others to build focus and lend their power to her workings, the community needs the effort of all to survive.
1072766	You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.  The human vermin that have spread as a disease, despoiling the land are the greatest blight we face.  Kill humans and return to me the proof of your actions. Bring me 30 human ears.
1072767	*nods* Not everyone has the temperment to undertake the way of the Arcanist.
1072768	You endanger your progress along the path with your unwillingness.
1072769	The people have need of these items.  You are proving yourself inadequate to the demands of a member of this community.
1072770	Do not falter now.  You have begun to show promise.
1072771	You must serve Sosaria with all your heart and strength.  Your unwillingness does not reflect favorably upon you.

1072773	You waste my time.  The task is simple. Kill 50 rats in an hour.
1072774	The mushrooms I seek can be found growing here in The Heartwood. Seek them out and gather them.  You are running out of time.
1072775	I care not where you acquire the cotton, merely that you provide it.
1072776	The requirements are simple -- 250 boards.
1072777	Where are the items you've been tasked to supply for the feast?
1072778	Why do you delay?  The human blight must be averted.
1072779	Every moment you procrastinate, these unnatural creatures damage Sosaria.
1072780	You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.  Unnatural creatures, brought to a sort of perverted life, despoil our fair world.  Destroy them -- 5 Exodus Overseers and 2 Exodus Minions.

1072962	What's that? *alarmed gasp*  Do not speak of the Black Order so loudly, they might hear and take offense.  *whispers*  I collect the badges of their sects, if you wish to seek them out and slay them.  Bring five of each and I will reward you.
1072963	I have a task for you ... adventurer.  Will you risk all to win great renown?  The Black Order is organized into three sects, each with their own speciality.  The Dragon's Flame serves the will of the Grand Mage, the Tiger's Claw answers to the Master Thief, and the Serpent's Fang kills at the direction of the High Executioner.  Slay all three and you will strike the order a devastating blow!
1072964	We believe the Black Order has fallen under the sway of Minax, somehow.  Seek evidence that proves our theory by piercing the secrets of the Citadel.
1072965	You have discovered a bundle of stolen property.  Will you return it to its rightful owner?
1072966	The Dragon's Flame sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human or elf.  Either race will do, I care not for the shape of their ears.  Yes, this action will properly make clear my disapproval and has a pleasing harmony.
1072967	I wish to make a statement of censure against the elite ninjas of the Black Order.  Deliver, in the strongest manner, my disdain.  But do not make war on women, even those that take arms against you.  It is not ... fitting.
1072968	The Tiger's Claw sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human and elf.
1072969	The Serpent's Fang sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human and elf.
1072970	You have discovered a contracted agreement of assassination.  Perhaps the individual named in the contract would pay gladly for the document?
1072971	*whisper* It's a very dangerous task.  Let me know if you change your mind.
1072972	*whisper* The Citadel entrance is disguised as a fishing village.  The magical portal into the stronghold itself is moved frequently.  You'll need to search for it.
1072973	I do not fault your decision.
1072974	Once you gain entrance into The Citadel, you will need to move cautiously to find the sect leaders.
1072975	Many fear to tangle with the wicked sorceress.  I understand and appreciate your concerns.
1072976	I don't know where inside The Citadel such evidence could be found.  Perhaps the most guarded sanctum is the place to look.
1072977	Of course, you could also choose to keep the bundle.
1072978	Examine the package for the name and location of its rightful owner.
1072979	As you wish.
1072980	The Black Order's fortress home is well hidden.  Legend has it that a humble fishing village disguises the magical portal.
1072981	Or perhaps you'd rather not.
1072982	Examine the contract for the name and location of the intended victim.

1073010	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill ten skeletal mounts.
1073011	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill eight patchwork skeletons.
1073012	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill twelve ghouls.
1073013	You can't trust them, you know.  Lizardmen I mean.  They have forked tongues ... and you know what that means.  Exterminate ten of them and I'll reward you.
1073014	They may not be bright, but they're incredibly destructive.  Kill off ten trolls and I'll consider it a favor done for me.
1073015	Those green-skinned freaks have run off with more of my livestock.  I want an orc scout killed for each sheep I lost and an orc for each chicken.  So that's four orc scouts and eight orcs I'll pay you to slay.
1073016	Disgusting!  The way they scuttle on those hairy legs just makes me want to gag.  I hate spiders!  Rid the world of twelve and I'll find something nice to give you in thanks.
1073017	It's a big job but you look to be just the adventurer to do it!  I'm so glad you came by ... I'm paying well for the death of five ogres and five ettins.  Hop to it, if you're so inclined.
1073018	I bet you can't kill ... say ten ... lava lizards!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073019	Hahahaha!  I knew it!
1073020	I bet you can't kill ... say twelve ... flesh golems!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... <br>
1073021	I bet you can't kill ... ten gore fiends!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... <br>
1073022	I bet you can't kill ... ten harpies!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073023	I bet you can't kill ... ten gibberlings!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073024	I bet you can't tangle with those nasty plants ... say eight corpsers and two swamp tentacles!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073025	I bet you can't tangle with those bloodsuckers ... say around ten vampire bats!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073026	You've got to help me out! Those wild ostards have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  There are around twelve of them.
1073027	It's a big job but you look to be just the adventurer to do it!  I'm so glad you came by ... I'm paying well for the death of six giant ice serpents and six frost spiders.  Hop to it, if you're so inclined.<br>
1073028	You've got to help me out! Those dire wolves have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  They run around in a pack of around ten.<br>
1073029	You've got to help me out! Those ratmen have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  I'll pay you if you kill off twelve of those dirty rats.<br>
1073030	A pity really.  With the balance of nature awry, we have no choice but to accept the responsibility of making it all right.  It's all a part of the circle of life, after all. So, yes, the grizzly bears are running rampant. There are far too many in the region.  Will you shoulder your obligations as a higher life form?<br>
1073031	Have you ever seen what a slime can do to good gear?  Well, it's not pretty, let me tell you!  If you take on my task to destroy twelve of them, bear that in mind.  They'll corrode your equipment faster than anything.
1073032	I admire them, you know.  The solen have their place -- regimented, organized.  They're fascinating to watch with their constant strife between red and black.  I can't help but want to stir things up from time to time.  And that's where you come in.  Kill either twelve red or twelve black solen workers and let's see what happens next!
1073033	I imagine you don't know about the mongbats.  Well, you may think you do, but I know more than just about anyone.  You see they come in two varieties ... the stronger and the weaker.  Either way, they're a menace.  Exterminate ten of the weaker ones and four of the stronger and I'll pay you an honest wage.
1073034	Disgusting!  The way they scuttle on those hairy legs just makes me want to gag.  I hate spiders and anything like them!  Rid the world of twelve terathan drones and I'll reward you.
1073035	A gorilla once bit my sister.  No, really.  So, I'm on a crusade to have the filthy beasts destroyed once and for all.  Kill eight of them and I'll make it worth your while.
1073036	I bet you can't handle ten plague spawns!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ...
1073037	Welcome to the Prism of Light Cavern Exhibit.
1073038	The cavern, located deep beneath the Nujel'm Palace, was discovered by Lord Graye Denthe.
1073039	The caverns contain more than 2 dozen varieties of crystals.
1073040	Only Malas and the Prism of Light Caverns have these naturally occurring crystals.
1073041	The cavern is also known for the rich supply of gems scattered throughout the rock.
1073042	Most of the cavern is off limits to the general public because of the instability of the cavern system.
1073043	Lord Denthe disappeared after venturing into the cavern. No sign of him has been seen since.
1073044	Crystals often form in cluster-like formations in the dark recesses of the cavern.

1073300	Library Friends - Quotes from the pen of Sherry the Mouse
1073301	Oft have I wished that stranger would return.
1073302	A shard of a universe is a powerful thing.
1073303	Aid the nobility that resideth in human heart.
1073304	Yet sometimes one must sacrifice a pawn to save a king.
1073305	Even pawns have lives and loves at home, my lord.
1073306	But I am but a mouse, and none hear me.
1073307	We must bring the shards into harmony, so that they resonate in such a manner that matches the original universe.
1073308	Suddenly the shutters blew open, and Lord British fell to the ground, one hand shileding his eyes.
1073309	I witnessed them all from my tiny mousehole.
1073310	Library Friends - Quotes from the pen of Wyrd Beastmaster
1073311	I have not much to tell about dragons.
1073312	The fireball was massive enough to light a city I should surmise.
1073313	The sole time I approached one with an eye towards taming it, my initial attempts at calming it met with failure.
1073314	...the dragon suddenly whirled as if in a panic, ran a short distance, took off into the air, then transformed into a whirlwind.
1073315	I never did discover the exact cause of this strange behavior except to assume that it was not typical for this reptilian species.
1073316	Hence my basic advice to those who seek to tame a dragon-be sure that thou hast mastered the twin skills of taming animals, and running away very fast.
1073317	Library Friends - Quotes from the pen of Mercenary Justin
1073318	Be wary of a brazier that giveth warning when approached: thou canst use it to summon deadly creatures.

1073320	Do not investigate the iron maidens too closely, for they make suck you within them!
1073321	There is one place where a deadly trap can only be disarmed by making use of a statue that cleverly conceals a lever.
1073322	Oft one encounters the deadly exploding toadstool

1073326	Wisps are the most intelligent of the nonhuman races inhabiting Britannia.
1073327	Library Friends - Quotes from the pen of Heigel of Moonglow
1073328	The wispish language seems to only contain one vowel, the letter Y.
1073329	The average word in wispish seems to consist of three phonemes and three glottal stops, plus possibly a pitch shift.
1073330	Wisps do make use of what sounds to us like pitch and emphasis shifts similar to exclamations and questions.
1073331	Some have speculated that what we are analyzing is in fact nothing more than the very air crackling near the wisp's glow, and not language, but this is of course unlikely.
1073332	Her name was Leyla, she said, and her hair was braided wild with creepers and thorns.
1073333	Her provenance, she told me over nights illuminated by campfires, was once the city of Trinsic.

1073336	He had sandy hair like thee, and I dreamt as a child of holding his hand and sharing flavored ice. His name was Japheth.
1073337	...her smile seemed full of teeth sharper than a human ought to have, for the tale of orcish raising had struck fear into the marrow of my bones.

1073560	In memory of Mordanna
1073561	Can you hear them? The never-ending howling? The incessant wailing? These banshees, they never cease! Never! They haunt my nights. Please, I beg you -- will you silence them? I would be ever so grateful.
1073562	Some say killing a boggling brings good luck. I don't place much stock in old wives' tales, but I can say a few dead bogglings would certainly be lucky for me! Help me out and I can reward you for your efforts.
1073563	Nobody told me about the Mummy's Curse. How was I supposed to know you shouldn't disturb the tombs? Oh, sure, now all I hear about is the curse of the vengeful dead. I'll tell you what -- make a few of these mummies go away and we'll keep this between you and me.
1073564	You want to hear about trouble? I got trouble. How's angry piles of granite walking around for trouble? Maybe they don't like the mining, maybe it's the farming. I don't know. All I know is someone's got to turn them back to potting soil. And it'd be worth a pretty penny to the soul that does it.
1073565	Please, hear me kind traveler. You know when a knight falls, sometimes they are cursed to roam the earth as undead mockeries of their former glory? That is too grim a fate for even any knight to suffer! Please, put them out of their misery. I will offer you what payment I can if you will end the torment of these undead wretches.
1073566	It is a piteous thing when the dead continue to walk the earth. Restless spirits are known to inhabit these parts, taking the lives of unwary travelers. It is about time a hero put the dead back in their graves. I'm sure such a hero would be justly rewarded.
1073567	Imps! Do you hear me? Imps! They're everywhere! They're in everything! Oh, don't be fooled by their size -- they vicious little devils! Half-sized evil incarnate, they are! Somebody needs to send them back to where they came from, if you know what I mean.
1073568	The Terathan are an aggressive species. Left unchecked, they will swarm across our lands. And where will that leave us? Compost in the hive, that's what! Stop them, stop them cold my friend. Kill their warriors and you'll check their movement, that is certain.
1073569	I've seen them hiding in their webs among the woods. Glassy eyes, spindly legs, poisonous fangs. Monsters, I say! Deadly horrors, these black widows. Someone must exterminate the abominations! If only I could find a worthy hero for such a task, then I could give them this considerable reward.
1073570	Why must the dead plague the living? With their foul necromancy and dark sorceries, the undead menace the countryside. I fear what will happen if no one is strong enough to face these nightmare sorcerers and thin their numbers.
1073571	Foul brutes! No one loves an orc, but some of them are worse than the rest. Their Captains and their Bombers, for instance, they're the worst of the lot. Kill a few of those, and the rest are just a rabble. Exterminate a few of them and you'll make the world a sunnier place, don't you know.
1073572	Thank goodness, a hero like you has arrived! Brigands have descended upon this area like locusts, stealing and looting where ever they go. We need someone to put these vile curs where they belong -- in their graves. Are you up to the task?
1073573	A Solen hive is a fascinating piece of ecology. It's put together like a finely crafted clock. Who knows what happens if you remove something? So let's find out. Exterminate a few of the warriors and I'll make it worth your while.
1073574	Kind traveler, hear my plea. You know of the evil orbs? The wrathful eyes? Some call them gazers? They must be a nest nearby, for they are tormenting us poor folk. We need to drive back their numbers. But we are not strong enough to face such horrors ourselves, we need a true hero.
1073575	Vermin! They get into everything! I told the boy to leave out some poisoned cheese -- and they shot him. What else can I do? Unless…these ratmen are skilled with a bow, but I'd lay a wager you're better, eh? Could you skin a few of the wretches for me?
1073576	The woods in these parts are restless. Wrathful trees, walking about. Why, they're a menace to decent folk! And I'm running low on firewood, so what do you say? Could you turn a few reapers into some useful lumber?
1073577	Were you the sort of child that enjoyed knocking over anthills? Well, perhaps you'd like to try something a little bigger? There's a Solen nest nearby and I bet if you killed a queen or two, it would be quite the sight to behold.  I'd even pay to see that -- what do you say?
1073578	It makes no sense! Cold blooded serpents cannot live in the ice! It's a biological impossibility! They are an abomination against reason! Please, I beg you -- kill them! Make them disappear for me! Do this and I will reward you.
1073579	The universe is all about balance my friend. Tip one end, you must balance the other. That's why I must ask you to kill not just one kind of elemental, but three kinds. Snuff out some Fire, douse a few Water, and crush some Earth elementals and I'll pay you for your trouble.
1073580	I hope you'll reconsider. Until then, farwell.
1073581	Until you kill 12 Wailing Banshees, there will be no peace.
1073582	Go back and kill all 20 bogglings!
1073583	Uh, I don't think you're quite done killing Mummies yet. <br>
1073584	You got rocks in your head? I said to kill 12 earth elementals, okay?<br>
1073585	Your task is not done. Continue putting the Skeleton and Bone Knights to rest.<br>
1073586	The restless spirts still walk -- you must kill 15 of them.
1073587	Don't let the little devils scare you! You  kill 12 imps -- then we'll talk reward.<br>
1073588	Unless you kill at least 10 Terathan Warriors, you won't have any impact on their hive.<br>
1073589	You've got a good start, but to stop the black-eyed fiends, you need to kill a dozen. <br>
1073590	Surely, a brave soul like yourself can kill 10 Bone Magi and Skeletal Mages?<br>
1073591	The only good orc is a dead orc -- and 4 dead Captains and 6 dead Bombers is even better!<br>
1073592	The Brigands still plague us. Have you killed 20 of their number?<br>
1073593	I don't think you've gotten their attention yet -- you need to kill at least 10 Solen Warriors.<br>
1073594	Have you annihilated a dozen Gazers yet, kind traveler?<br>
1073595	I don't see 10 tails from Ratman Archers on your belt -- and until I do, no reward for you.<br>
1073596	I'm thinking of building a small shed and the lumber of 15 reapers would be just about right.<br>
1073597	Dead Solen Queens isn't too much to ask, is it?
1073598	You wouldn't try and just pretend you murdered 10 Giant Ice Worms, would you?<br>
1073599	Four of each, that's all I ask. Water, earth and fire. <br>
1073600	Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.
1073601	Finally, some peace and quiet! You've more than earned this reward.
1073602	Well, I don't feel any luckier, but there's sure a lot less bogglings about. Good job, my friend.<br>
1073603	Nice work. Now, here's something for your trouble -- and this will stay between you and me, right?<br>
1073604	Well, you're turned them rocky horrors into gravel, didn't you? You've got my thanks -- and this reward.<br>
1073605	You've done a noble deed, putting these undead down. I only wish I could give you a greater reward than this.<br>
1073606	The spirits are now at peace. Please, take this as a reward for your work.<br>
1073607	Oh, I hope those little buggers are burning where you sent 'em! Here's a little something to fill out your purse.<br>
1073608	My friend, take this reward for your work in driving back the Terathan hive.<br>
1073609	I haven't seen a single web since you cleared the area. You've more than earned this.<br>
1073610	Pleace accept this modest offer for your bravery in facing those undead sorcerers.<br>
1073611	Mmm. Smells like dead orc, out there! Nicely turned! Fatten your purse with this, then!<br>
1073612	You've brought a measure of peace to this area. Please, accept this meager offering as reward.<br>
1073613	It's fascinating to watch the nest in action, isn't it? Here's something for your trouble.<br>
1073614	I no longer feel their prying gaze of evil upon me. For that, I give thanks to you -- here's is your reward.<br>
1073615	Hmm, looks like you've built the better rat-trap. Enjoy a little reward then!<br>
1073616	Yes, I like these woods much better without the trees wandering about. Nice job. <br>
1073617	Did you seem them run around? Wasn't that great? Here, take this reward -- that’s the most fun I've had in days.<br>
1073618	I think Giant Ice Worms are a myth, don't you? Shh, I don't want to talk about it -- just take the money and be gone.
1073619	You've restored the natural balance friend and earned this generous reward.<br>
1073620	You have not learned this recipe.
1073621	Your reward has been placed in your backpack.

1073693	Riddle Me This
1073694	I must implore you, brave traveler, to do battle with the vile reptiles which haunt these parts. Those hideous abominations, the Ophidians, are a blight across the land. If you were able to put down a host of the scaly warriors, the Knights or the Avengers, I would forever be in your debt.
1073695	There's been a bumper crop of evil with the Bog Things in these parts, my friend. Though they are foul creatures, they are also most fecund. Slay one and you make the land more fertile. Even better, slay several and I will give you whatever coin I can spare.
1073696	Psst. Listen close my friend, for I'll not speak of this again. Unicorns. You know them, I know them. I need a number of them gone. Don't ask why something you beautiful needs to be destroyed. If you can manage the task, I have the means to reward you handsomely.
1073697	It is regretable that the Gargoyles insist upon warring with us. Their Enforcers attack men on sight, despite all efforts at reason. To help maintain order in this region, I have been authorized to encourage bounty hunters to reduce their numbers. Eradicate their number and I will reward you handsomely.
1073698	You think you've seen destruction and horror, my friend? You haven't seen anything until you've seen what a Giant Beetle can do to a nicely tilled garden. There's been a swarm of 'em lately. I don't have much, but if you could rid the area of a few, I'm sure I could find something to reward you with.
1073699	If I had but one wish, it would be to rid myself of these dread Efreet! Fire and ash, they are cunning and deadly! You look a brave soul --would you be interested in earning a rich reward for slaughtering a few of the smoky devils?
1073700	Is there anything more foul than a pixie? They have cruel eyes and a mind for mischief, I say. I don't care if some think they're cute -- I say kill them and let the Avatar sort them out. In fact, if you were to kill a few pixies, I'd make sure you had a few coins to rub together, if you get my meaning.
1073701	They aren't called Dread Spiders because they're fluffy and cuddly now, are they? No, there's nothing appealing about those wretches so I sure wouldn't lose any sleep if you were to exterminate a few. I'd even part with a generous amount of gold, I would.
1073702	Feel that chill in the air? It means an icy death for the unwary, for deadly Ice Elementals are about. Who knows what magic summoned them, what's important now is getting rid of them. I don't have much, but I'll give all I can if you'd only stop the cold-hearted monsters.
1073703	I should be trimming back the vegetation here, but something nasty has taken root. Vicious vines I can't go near. If there's any hope of getting things under control, some one's going to need to destroy a few of those Whipping Vines. Someone strong and fast and tough.
1073704	Ants are industrious and Lions are noble so who'd think an Ant Lion would be such a problem? The Ant Lions have been causing mindless destruction in these parts. I suppose it's just how ants are. But I need you to help eliminate the infestation. Would you be willing to help for a bit of reward?<br>
1073705	They're unholy, I say. Golems, a walking mockery of all life, born of blackest magic. They're not truly alive, so destroying them isn't a crime, it's a service. A service I will gladly pay for.
1073706	It baffles me how a Ratman can be smart enough to learn magic. But, I don't think they're so smart you couldn't kill a few. The beady-eyed fiends have been causing trouble in these parts, so I'd be glad to reward someone who thinned their numbers.
1073707	The flap of their leathery wings, the scratch of their reptillian claws, the clank of their scales. Keep your eyes open, friend for there are Drakes in these parts. The unwary find themselves a hot meal for the cold blooded fiends. I'd give all the treasure I possess to anyone brave enough to scourge a number of those devils from our fair skies.
1073708	From the foul depths, the Kraken come to torment men. The scaly horrors make life near impossible for us all. I know it may not be much, but I'd gladly reward any who were fearless enough to face the Kraken and reduce their host!
1073709	I have a business proposition for you, my friend. Caravans would like to move freely across our fair deserts except the accursed Sand Vortexes always attack them. If you could, say "disenchant" a few Vortexes, I could compensate you for your efforts in encouraging free trade.
1073710	These demon horses mock the bond between rider and steed! It pains me to see such despicable monsters in the shape of a noble horse. Please, execute these unholy mockeries, the Nightmares or the Fire Steeds, for me -- do this, and I will gladly reward you.
1073711	You've heard of a snake in the grass? How about a serpent in a lava field? Those fiery monsters cause no end of trouble, slithering and burning. Find a way to turn a few lava serpents into charcoal and I'll make sure you leave with a heavy purse.
1073712	Those frosty brutes! It's impossible to make a decent bonfire with them about! I'm talking about those masters of ice magic, the Arctic Ogre Lords. Yes, I'd certainly add a few coins to the purse of anyone tough enough to turn a few of those brutes into ice cubes!
1073713	Devils of snow and ice! They steal the warmth from our very souls! If only someone were brave enough to face the dread Ice Fiends and reduce their numbers, then decent folk might have a chance for once!
1073714	From the Stygian depths, the Daemons rise to torment poor humankind! I've seen them, cutting a swath of destruction through our fair land. But you, you seem a hardy adventurous sort. Perhaps you have experience in slaying foul daemons?
1073715	Corpulent foul-smelling brutes! Without their leaders, your average ogre is such a menace. But as long as the Ogre Lords are around, they whip that unsightly rabble into shape. Hmm, makes you think we should target a few of these Orge Lords, doesn't it?
1073716	They watching me! Shh! They might hear! They've had their eyes on me for a while -- no, I'm not paranoid! Have you seen the way they look at me? Elder Gazers, indeed! Why do they observe me so? Please, kind traveler -- kill the fiends! Close their never-blinking eyes once and for all and I will gladly reward you!
1073717	My dear old mum, she does hate those awful Terathan. She'd like nothing better than to wreck their hives. Hmm, you know -- kill a Terathan Matriarch and the hive drops in efficiency. I wonder…perhaps someone who targeted a few Terathan Matriarchs would do some damage to the Hive. That'd sure make my old mum proud....
1073718	To live among giants is no easy task my friend. Take these Titans. Their appetites are prodigious, indeed. They consume all in their path trying to placate their enormous hunger! It leaves precious little for us to feed ourselves. I may not be wealthy, but if someone could kill a few Titans, I could afford to be generous with them.
1073719	You've probably slain your fair share of the common orc, eh? Orcs are a dime a dozen, but the Orc Brute -- that's a different story entirely! They're hideous monsters who've earned their deaths a dozen times over! How about giving the lumpen oafs the death they so richly deserve?
1073720	Does it seem uncommonly warm here? I think it does. I've seen Fire Gargoyles nearby. Those burning wretches turn to ash everything they touch. Do you know what does for property values? Do us all a favor and fight fire with fire -- kill some Fire Gargoyles for me.
1073721	Beware the White Wyrm, my friend! They are not a beast to be trifled with. I've seen them gut villages and swallow peasants whole! My hatred for the albino atrocities runs deep -- so deep, I'd give all that I own to rid the land of them.
1073722	Did you know Poison Elementals are corrupted from the very air? They are miserable wretches, cursed by foul magic. You do them a favor by destroying the noxious creatures -- they'd surely thank you, though you might not notice it for them trying to kill you. But, I could find it in my heart to reward you for killing poison elementals.
1073723	There is no greater foe than the mighty Dragon! A creature of myth and legend! A hero proves his worth by slaughtering the reptillian fiends! What? You're not swayed by my words? Well, would you be interested in a cash reward for killing dragons then?
1073724	Death all around us, like a plague of, uh, pestilence! Those undead magicians, the Liches, torment the living! And their masters, the Lich Lords are the worst of the bunch. I'll tell you, I'd give this large treasure pile to anyone who cleared these undead monsters!
1073725	Their girly bits are…exposed! There, out in the open, for any child to see! A succubus is an affront to all decency and morality! Someone needs to stand up for the children! Someone needs to teach the succubi a lesson in decency!
1073726	The Gargoyles think they're the superior race! Their Destroyers are the pinnacle of their warriors! But I know, humans are deadlier by far and I'll pay you to prove it to the red-skinned wretches!
1073727	The Lords of the Underworld have grown bold! They march across the land, terrorizing and rampaging! But without their leaders, the Balrons, the legions of the nether realms aren't nearly the threat. I could reward you handsomely if you could cut the head off of a demon army or two.
1073728	Oh, the cruel irony! A hero slays a dragon, only for it to come back as an undead monstrosity thanks to black magic. These Skeletal Wyrms are twice the fiend they ever were in life and it will take twice the hero to put them down again!
1073729	They say the Serpentine Dragons hail from far off lands. Well, that's just wrong. I mean, what, are native dragons supposed to compete with cheap foreign dragons? It's not fair! I think somebody should do something about it!
1073730	Every undead horror was once a living soul. Can you imagine, the poor wretches who become Rotting Corpses? What if some part of them knows what they've become? It's too horrible! Someone should return them to the ground.
1073731	The older a wyrm gets, the more deadly and cunning. The Ancient Wyrms are a treacherous breed, each one soaked in the blood of innocents. A hero needs to right their wrongs, eradicate their evil from fair Britannia.
1073732	Here's a riddle for you. Why hasn't anyone killed those annoying Sphinxes? With their puzzles and enigmatic ways, why we'd be better off without 'em all. In fact, I'll put my money where my mouth is -- kill Sphinxes and I'll reward you well.
1073733	Perhaps you'll change your mind and return at some point.
1073734	If you decide to return, I'll be waiting here.
1073735	Have you killed the Ophidian Knights or Avengers?
1073736	Continue to seek and kill the Bog Things.
1073737	There's still too many unicorns around, if you catch my drift.
1073738	I won't be able to pay you until you've gotten enough Gargoyle Enforcers.
1073739	Did you forget to kill Giant Beetles?
1073740	Those smoky devils, the Efreets, are still about.
1073741	There's too much cuteness in the world -- kill those pixies!
1073742	Dread Spiders? I say keep exterminating the arachnid vermin.
1073743	The chill won't lift until you eradicate a few Ice Elemenals.
1073744	How are farmers supposed to work with these Whipping Vines around?
1073745	Please, rid us of the Ant Lion infestation.
1073746	The unholy brutes, the Golems, must be smited!
1073747	I think someone should skin a few ratmen mages, eh?
1073748	A drake's almost a dragon but I still think you can take 'em.
1073749	Please, help stop the Kraken menace.
1073750	These Sand Vortexes make life impossible!
1073751	Don't let the Nightmares or Fire Steeds continue to walk this earth.
1073752	Those fiery serpents are still too many.
1073753	There's more Arctic Ogre Lords to kill, I'm sure of that.
1073754	I'm sure you can kill a few more Ice Fiends than that.
1073755	The Daemon hordes still need to be thinned.
1073756	Please, continue to battle the Ogre Lords.
1073757	What are you looking at? Go kill Elder Gazers!
1073758	Mum will be disappointed if you don't kill more Terathan Matriarchs.
1073759	I hope you haven't had your fill of killing Titans.
1073760	There's plenty more Orc Brutes who need killing.
1073761	Do not lose hope, you can face more Fire Gargoyles, I am certain.
1073762	The White Wyrms still trouble this land!
1073763	I beseech you, put more Poison Elementals out of their misery.
1073764	Prove you’re a hero -- kill some more Dragons!
1073765	Lich Lords still haunt our fair lands.
1073766	Do the decent thing and kill those horrible succubi!
1073767	There are plenty more Gargoyle Destroyers to, uh, destroy.
1073768	Balrons cannot be allowed to walk on the earth. Keep fighting them, please!
1073769	Reduce a few more Skeletal Wyrms to a pile of bones.
1073770	You've made a good start but those Serpentine Dragons need to be taught a lesson.
1073771	I can still smell the foul decay of Rotting Corpses.
1073772	Fight the Ancient Wyrms, please!
1073773	Please, do no rest until those Sphinxes are properly schooled!<br>
1073774	You have finished your quest and may return for a reward.
1073775	Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.
1073776	We can all rest a little easier with less of those slithery Ophidians about. You've earned this reward.
1073777	The land appreciates your efforts with the Bog Things. We should have a bumper crop this year!
1073778	Okay, here's your reward. Now, we never spoke, did we?
1073779	Those Gargoyle fanatics won't be troubling anyone any time soon, eh?
1073780	Tell me, do the Giant Beetles crunch when you kill them? Well, here's your pay.
1073781	Ha! Blown away like smoke in the wind, those Efreets are! You earned this reward!
1073782	The world is a less magical place, with dead pixies. Good job.
1073783	Thinking about those eight legged monsters gives me the chills! Here, take this reward.
1073784	You snapped that cold spell, eh? For facing the Ice Elementals, here's a little something.
1073785	With the whipping vines thinned, farmers can get back to work.
1073786	The Ant Lion infestation seems reduced. Enjoy this reward then.
1073787	Reduced those Golems to component parts? Good, then -- you deserve this reward!
1073788	Ha, the furry wretches' magic was no match for you! A dead ratman mage is worth something, so enjoy!
1073789	The skies have been clear of drakes lately, so I guess you deserve a reward.
1073790	There's hasn't been a Kraken attack lately -- congratulations!
1073791	Trade is up fifteen percent since you attacked the Sand Vortexes. You've earned a share of the profit.
1073792	You've cleared the stables of evil, my friend! So here are your just rewards!
1073793	For your work against the lava snakes, I have a little something for you.
1073794	It'll be a cold day in you-know-where when you can't kill Artic Ogre Lords, eh?
1073795	I already feel the warmth returning. Accept this reward for killing Ice Fiends!
1073796	Sent them back where they belong, eh? Good work.
1073797	The world will not miss those blubbery brutes. For what you've done, enjoy this reward.
1073798	Don't look at me that way. Just take your reward and leave.
1073799	Mother will appreciate your fine work. Here, don't tell her I gave you this.
1073800	The shadow of Titans no longer stretches across the land. Thanks to you!
1073801	Thanks to you for stopping those orcish louts. You deserve this rich reward.
1073802	You have extinguished the gargoyle threat, traveler. Thanks to you.
1073803	Those pale monsters are no more. Enjoy the rewards of the just!
1073804	You have performed a noble service. Here, please take this reward.
1073805	Dragons mean treasure my friend -- enjoy this reward!
1073806	I can only hope these undead stay in their graves once and for all.
1073807	Thanks goodness someone thinks of the children. Enjoy this token of our esteem.
1073808	The gargoyle menace has been thwarted. Thank you, traveler.
1073809	You faced the hordes of the underworld and overcame. For that, I will be forever grateful.
1073810	With any luck, those dragons won't be back again!
1073811	You sent those foreign dragons packing, didn't you? My thanks!
1073812	The stench of decay subsides, thanks to you.
1073813	You've rid the land of an ancient evil. My best wishes, friend.
1073814	Mystery solved! Enjoy your reward, my friend.

1073974	I say truly -- that is a magnificent garment! You have more than earned a reward.

1073998	Blessings of Sosaria to you and merry met, friend.
1073999	I am glad for your company and wonder if you seek the heritage of your people?  I sense within you an elven bloodline -- the purity of which was lost when our brothers and sisters were exiled here in the Rupture.
1074000	If it is your desire to reclaim your place amongst the people, you must demonstrate that you understand and embrace the responsibilities expected of you as an elf.
1074001	The most basic lessons of our Sosaria are taught by her humblest children.  Seek Maul, the great bear, who understands instictively the seasons.
1074002	You have begun to walk the path of reclaiming your heritage, but you have not learned all the lessons before you.
1074003	You yet must perform these services:
1074004	You have carved a path in history, sought to understand the way from our sage companions.
1074005	And now you have returned full circle to the place of your origin within the arms of Mother Sosaria. There is but one thing left to do if you truly wish to embrace your elven heritage.
1074006	To be born once more an elf, you must strip of all worldly possessions. Nothing of man or beast much touch your skin.
1074007	Then you may step forth into history.
1074008	You change your Reward Title to "~1_TITLE~".
1074009	You decide to leave your title as it is.
1074010	You elect to hide your Reward Title.

1074063	Fine then, I'm shall find another to run my errands then.
1074064	Hurry up! I don't have all day to wait for you to bring what I desire!
1074065	These human made goods are laughable! It offends so -- I must show you what elven skill is capable of!
1074066	We elves are no strangers to marksmanship but I would be interested in learning whether there is anything to learn from the human approach. I would gladly trade you something I have if you could teach me of the deadly crossbow bolt.
1074067	I wish to try a bow crafted in the human style. Is it possible for you to bring me such a weapon? I would be happy to return this favor.
1074068	I have heard of a curious type of bow, you call it a "crossbow". It sounds fascinating and I would very much like to examine one closely. Would you be able to obtain such an instrument for me?
1074069	These human "crossbows" are complex and clever. The "heavy crossbow" is a remarkable instrument of war. I am interested in seeing one up close, if you could arrange for one to make its way to my hands.
1074070	My friend, I am in search of a device, a instrument of remarkable human ingenuity. It is a repeating crossbow. If you were to obtain such a device, I would gladly reveal to you some of the secrets of elven craftsmanship.
1074071	Humans artistry can be a remarkable thing. For instance, I have heard of a wonderful instrument which creates the most melodious of music. A lap harp. I would be ever so grateful if I could examine one in person.
1074072	How clever humans are -- to understand the need of feet to rest from time to time!  Imagine creating a special stool just for weary toes.  I would like to examine and learn the secret of their making.  Would you bring me some foot stools to examine?
1074073	Humans have remarkable desire to secure what they "possess". I would be fascinated to see how a human would choose to contain something in a wooden chest. Do you think you could bring me such an item, in exchange for knowledge of elven ways?
1074074	The manner by which humans produce cloth is remarkable. A spinning wheel -- how clever! Could you arrange for me to experiement with such a device?
1074075	I understand men decorate their living spaces with furniture such as a cherry armoire. It sounds like a beautiful, if strange invention. I would appreciate an opportunity to examine the craftsmanship on such an object.
1074076	Such a simple ingredient, yet so versatile! Sweet dough -- what can it not do? I would love to experiment and discover new frontier in the baking arts -- if only I had a supply of this sweet dough.
1074077	I have heard tales of a potent dish. One that is both strong, yet delicate. Rich, but light. A baked quiche. Such culinary wizardry sounds delightful and I would be very appreciative to one who could provide me with such a meal.
1074078	I am told of a speciality dish, a meal of carefully prepared fish. Such a sushi platter must be sublime in its delicacy. I would be eternally grateful if you could provide me with such meal.
1074079	Humans have a splendid dish I am told, one that harvests the fruits of nature and tastes like drops of the golden sun! A peach cobbler. Such a dish must be priceless, but if you could provide it for me to taste, I would happily teach you more of the elven ways.
1074080	I desire to try a simple human meal. Something hearty, but simple. Perhaps, a cut of ribs? Yes, that sounds right. Perhaps, if you were to provide this for me, I could instruct you in the ways of elven cooking?
1074081	My friend, perhaps you are interested in elven wine? It is a wondrous elixir but I require a supply of that most precious fruit, a bunch of grapes. Please, bring some to me.<br>
1074082	I have discovered through great effort the dread after effects of human wine. My friend, I would be forever in your debt if you provide for me some of these cure potions which removes the efforts of noxious toxins.
1074083	I understand men are not unfamiliar with the winemaking arts. Does the wine of humans quench thirst like the dew off a morning lily? Perhaps I could see for myself?
1074084	We elves are interested in trading our wines with humans but we understand human usually trade such brew in strange transparent bottles. If you could provide some of these empty glass bottles, I might engage in a bit of elven winemaking
1074085	Oh, the deviltry! Why would humans lock their precious liquors inside a wooden coffin? I understand I need a "keg tap" to access the golden brew within such a wooden abomination. Perhaps, if you could bring me such a tap, we could share a drink and I could teach you.
1074086	What wonders! A concotion that let's one see in the darkest night! How marvelous! Perhaps, you would obtain for me such night sight potions so that I might banish the darkest from my eyes.
1074087	In a perilous world, one can never be too cautious. I understand mankind has developed a potion of healing to cure terrible injuries. I am certain we elves could benefit from this knowledge, so if you bring healing potions to me, I will teach you of elven lore.
1074088	These alchemy of humans is a wondrous and destructive art! I hear that an "explosive" potion produces a force of fiery potency when used. It sounds fascinating and I would like to see with my own eyes. Are you able to bring me such explosive potions?
1074089	The power of a great forrest fire contained in a simple glass container? How remarkable and terrible! I must see for myself. Could you bring for me some of these greater conflagration potions? I will, naturally, reciprocate the favor.
1074090	Human friend, tell me, is it true there is a dark side to the human art of alchemy? It is troubling to hear such tales -- I feel I must examine the toxins humans produce. Please, bring to me a supply of the deadliest poison humans craft. For this favor, I will grant you precious elven knowledge.
1074091	Most human apparel is…interesting to elven eyes. But there is one garment -- the flower garland -- which sounds very elven indeed. Could I see how a human crafts such an object of beauty? In exchange, I could share with you the wonders of elven garments.
1074092	I have heard noble tales of a fine and proud human garment. An article of clothing fit for both man and god alike. It is called a "kilt" I believe? Could you fetch for me some of these kilts so I that I might revel in their majesty and glory?
1074093	We elves believe that beauty is expressed in all things, including the garments we wear. I wish to understand more about human aesthetics, so please kind traveler -- could you bring to me magnificent examples of human fancy shirts? For my thanks, I could teach you more about the beauty of elven vestements.
1074094	Forgive me for saying this, but so much of human clothing is strange to elven eyes. For instance, the fur sarong. I have difficultry believing what I hear, so I must gaze upon it with my own two eyes. Bring some to me and I will happily repay the favor.
1074095	It is my understanding, the females of humankind actually wear on certain occasions a studded bustier? This is not simply a fanciful tale? Remarkable! It sounds hideously uncomfortable as well as ludicrously impractical. But perhaps, I simply do not understand the nuances of human clothing. Perhaps, I need to see such a studded bustier for myself?
1074096	What a thing, this human need to tinker. It seems there is no end to what might be produced with a set of Tinker's Tools. Who knows what an elf might build with some? Could you obtain some tinker's tools and bring them to me? In exchange, I offer you elven lore and knowledge.
1074097	Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?
1074098	The wonders of human invention! Turning sand and metal into a far-seeing eye! This is something I must experience for myself. Bring me some of these spyglasses friend human
1074099	Is it true human? There are those among your kind who can construct an autonomaton that mocks the shape of a man? It is a frightening but intriguing notion! I must see these golems for myself. Please, bring me a golem and I will reward you with an elven teaching.
1074100	To give voice to the passing wind, this is an idea worthy of an elf! Friend, bring me some of the amazing fancy wind chimes so that I may listen to the song of the passing breeze. Do this, and I will share with you treasured elven secrets.
1074101	I am curious to see the results of human blacksmithing. To examine the care and quality of a simple item. Perhaps, a simple bascinet helmet? Yes, indeed -- if you could bring to me some bascinet helmets, I would demonstrate my gratitude.
1074102	The clank of human iron and steel is strange to elven ears. For instance, the metallic heater shield which human warriors carry into battle. It is odd to an elf, but nevertheless intriguing. Tell me friend, could you bring me such an example of human smithing skill?
1074103	What would you say is a typical human instrument of war? Is a broadsword a typical example? I wish to see more of such human weapons, so I would gladly trade elven knowledge for human steel.
1074104	There is supposedly a terrible and impressive blade forged by the hand of man. The no-dachi, a sword which requires great smithy skills. I would be honored to view the work of such a mastery human smith. If you can assist me, I would be greatly honored.
1074105	Mankind, I am told, knows how to take the scales of a terrible dragon and forge them into powerful armor. Such a feat of craftsmanship! I would give anything to view such a creation -- I would even teach some of the prized secrets of the elven people.
1074106	Is there a finer metal than valorite? I hear tell of its wonders, but I confess I do not believe the half of it. I must see for myself. Kind human, bring me a supply of this valorite so that I might examine it more closely.
1074107	They say men greatly covet metal colored like the fair Sosarian sun. These golden ingot with their mystical properties are of great interest to the elven people. I would be greatly indebted to a human who brough me a supply of golden ingots.
1074108	Where does one get some of this horned leather, my friend? What are its properties? How difficult is it to work? Ah, perhaps these questions would be more easily answered if you simply brought me some of this horned leather. What do you say human?
1074109	I cannot help myself human. I see these balls of yarn and I wish to bat them around as if they were prey to be hunted. Please, human, bring me more of these strange and delightful balls of joys. Bring me more yarn!
1074110	Well, where are the cotton bales?
1074111	I have heard of a strange breed of magic, one that draws its power from the forces of death. This is not the elven way, but I confess my curiosity to understand more. Could you gather for me a quantity of the grave dust used in this necromantic magic?
1074112	What do humans know of marksmanship? Humans can barely shoot straight. Why, your efforts are absurd. In fact, I will make a wager -- if these so called human arrows I've heard about are really as effective and innovative as human braggarts would have me believe, then I'll trade you something useful.  I might even teach you something of elven craftsmanship.
1074113	Human craftsmanship! Ha! Why, take an elven bow. It will last for a lifetime, never break and always shoot an arrow straight and true. Can't say the same for a human, can you? Bring me some of these human made bows, and I will show you.
1074114	Leave it to a human to try and improve upon perfection. To take a bow and turn it into a mechanical contraption like a crossbow. I wish to see more of this sort of "invention". Fetch for me a crossbow, human.
1074115	How lazy is man! You cannot even be bothered to pull your own drawstring and hold an arrow ready? You must invent a device to do it for you? I cannot understand, but perhaps if I examine a heavy crossbow for myself, I will see their appeal. Go and bring me such a device and I will repay your meager favor.
1074116	More is always better for a human, eh? Take these repeating crossbows. What sort of mind invents such a thing? I must look at it more closely. Bring such a contraption to me and you'll receive a token for your efforts.
1074117	You think you know something of music? Laughable! Take your lap harp. Crude, indelicate instruments that make a noise not unlike the wailing of a choleric child or a dying cat. I will show you -- bring lap harps, and I will demonstrate.
1074118	Human fancy knows no bounds!  It's pathetic that they are so weak that they must create a special stool upon which to rest their feet when they recline!  Humans don't have any clue how to live.  Bring me some of these foot stools to examine and I may teach you something worthwhile.
1074119	You would lock away all your possessions, fearing thieves everywhere, wouldn't you human? It is folly to put things in your wooden chests, flimsy as they are. I will show you how inferior they are to elven craftsmanship.
1074120	Thread should woven by delicate touch, not so elaborate machine as a spinning wheel. Still, there is something intriguing about the human approach. Bring some spinning wheels, so I might see how inferior thread is created.
1074121	If an elf were to create a piece of furniture, you know it would be a thing of magnificent beauty! I will show you -- bring to me a cherry armoire, what some humans would call a "beautiful" thing. Bring this, and I will point out all the ways in which it is flawed.
1074122	I have tasted human breads and I find them pathetic and lacking. Perhaps, it is the ingredients? Bring for me some of this sweet dough so that I might see how you humans go wrong. Do this and I might show you how real food is created.
1074123	I wish that humans could cook something at least half-way palatable to an elf. But alas, it is all gruel. Though these baked quiches sound promising. I expect they're awful, but you never know. Perhaps, you could bring some for me to try?
1074124	I daresay, a human would eat dirt and straw if it were served on a plate. Raw fish and weeds of the ocean? To eat a sushi platter -- what madness! I can scarcely believe it. You must bring for me a sample of such fare, so that I may see for myself.
1074125	I am told human-made peach cobbler is a dish worthy of an elf's palate. This, I very much doubt. In fact, I will prove it. Fetch for me some of these peach cobblers and then I will show you a truly magnificent dish!
1074126	You hack the ribcage off of some beast and then eat it? And call that a meal? Absurd! I will not believe it until you bring me an example of these cuts of ribs, so I might see it for myself.
1074127	Humans take perfectly wonderful grapes and reduce them to the laundry water you call wine! I will show you real elven wine. Bring to me bunches of grapes, so you might know what true craftsmen can achieve.
1074128	I have sampled human vintage and it has made me deathy ill. I require a cure for such poison. Bring me some cure potions, so I might recover from what humans call "wine".
1074129	Do not think it ego when I say elves are superior in all ways. For example, bring a bottle of your wine so that I might gag it down. If you compare it to wonderful elven vintage and you will understand.
1074130	The only good thing I can say about human made bottles is that they are empty and may yet still be filled with elven wine. Go now, fetch a number of empty bottles so that I might save them from the fate of carrying human-made wine.
1074131	I have acquired a barrel of human brewed beer. I am loathe to drink it, but how else to prove how inferior it is? I suppose I shall need a barrel tap to drink. Go, bring me a barrel tap quickly, so I might get this over with.
1074132	Why do humans want to see in the dark? Lurking in shadows to spy on others, that sounds like a human to me! Well, elves can fight fire with fire. Bring me some of these night sight potions and we will even the score.
1074133	Humans are so clumsy and stupid, always hurting themselves. I suppose that's why they have healing potions. Hmmm, I wonder what goes into such a concotion? Go and fetch me a sample, so I might investigate.
1074134	If humans are going to have explosive potions, we elves must learn more about how they are brewed. I demand you bring some of these bottles of destruction to me right away!
1074135	The mindless destruction humans cause! They really brew potions of greater conflagration! I must see for myself -- bring me some directly, and I will reward you.
1074136	I knew humans were treacherous devils. Take the deadly poisons they brew! To be used against who, I wonder? Bring me deadly poison potions, so I might have proof of human's murderous ways.
1074137	Humans do not deserve to wear a thing such as a flower garland. Help me prevent such things from falling into the clumsy hands of humans -- bring me flower garlands!
1074138	I do not believe humans are so ridiculous as to wear something called a "kilt". Bring for me some of these kilts, if they truly exist, and I will offer you meager reward.
1074139	Humans call that a fancy shirt? I would wager the ends are frayed, the collar worn, the buttons loosely stitched. Bring me fancy shirts and I will demonstrate the many ways in which they are inferior.
1074140	To murder creatures of the forrest for such a ridiculous garment as a fur sarong! It boggles the mind. Perhaps, the skins of the poor animals can be made into a proper garment. Bring me fur sarongs, so I might bring some dignity to the dead creatures.
1074141	No self respecting elf female would ever wear a studded bustier! I will prove it -- bring me such clothing and I will show you how ridiculous they are!
1074142	Bring me some of these tinker's tools! I am certain, in the hands of an elf, they will fashion objects of ingenuity and delight that will shame all human invention! Hurry, do this quickly and I might deign to show you my skill.
1074143	Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?
1074144	Humans are so pathetically weak, they must be augmented by glass and metal! Imagine such a thing! I must see one of these spyglasses for myself, to understand the pathetic limits of human sight!
1074145	Imagine! A mechanical thing which mocks a man! A golem, what an idea. I am curious about how humans create such a monstrous thing. Perhaps, I can learn more to use it against the devious humans. Go, get me a golem so I might see it more closely.
1074146	I understand humans cruely enslave the very wind to their selfish whims! Fancy wind chimes, what a monstrous idea! You must bring me proof of this terrible depredation -- hurry, bring me wind chimes!
1074147	You want to discuss the pathetic qualities of human craftsmanship? How about their bascinet helmets -- weak and flimsy things, your head would be better protect by maple leaves or a bit of straw. I will show you -- bring me some bascinet helmets and I will show you how pathetic they are.
1074148	I doubt very much a human shield would stop a good stout elven arrow. You doubt me? I will show you -- get me some of these heater shields and I will piece them with sharp elven arrows!
1074149	Pathetic, this human craftsmanship! Take their broadswords -- overgrown butter knives, in reality. No, I cannot do them justice -- you must see for yourself. Bring me broadswords and I will demonstrate their feebleness.
1074150	Some humans think their no-dachis are impressive swords. I'd rather fight with an elven quill pen in hand! I will show you how clumsy and dull they are if you bring me a few, so that we might mock their inferior workmanship.
1074151	Forging a great suit of armor from the scales of a dragon seems an idea worthy of an elf -- so I'm sure these humans have ruined it. Bring me a complete suit of this dragon armor, so I might see all the ways in which humans have done an inferior job of creation.
1074152	Well, where are the boards?
1074153	Valorite is one of the few metals that seems worthy of an elf's attention. With such a metal, I could craft something that would demonstrate the pinnacle of elven superiority! Get me some valorite ingots so I might forge such an item!
1074154	Humans lust so terribly for gold. Pathetic really. They barely understand what can be done with the metal. I will demonstrate what elves can craft if you'll bring some of the golden ingots.
1074155	I require a quantity of horned leather to craft something that will inspire awe, wonder and fear among the sad humans. Hurry, fetch for me this horned leather so that I might shame human craftsmen everywhere!
1074156	Here's a task even a human could do. Bring me balls of yarn. Yes, balls of yarn. Even pathetically made human yarn will do, for in the hands of an elf, wonders can be achieved.
1074157	Humans will violate the graves of their own kind? Truly? I would have thought human indencency had some boundaries, but apparently, I am wrong. Prove this is true -- bring to me some human gathered grave dust.
1074158	Ah good, you're back.  We're eager for the feast.
1074159	As you open the iron maiden, your surroundings mysteriously change!
1074160	I will take the ears you have collected now.  Hand them here.
1074161	Access to Bedlam by invitation only
1074162	You notice a hole in the tree and climb down
1074163	You find a way to climb back outside the tree
1074164	An insane dryad comes out of a nearby tree and attacks you!
1074165	You feel dizzy from a lack of clear air
1074166	Have you gathered the mushrooms?
1074167	Well done!  Well done, indeed.  You are worthy to become an arcanist!
1074168	Seeker's Symbol
1074169	Suit yourself human.
1074170	I will not aid you human, unless you renounce your humanity.
1074171	Ahloestree, friend.
1074172	Certainly.  There is plenty of time to explore such things.  Return to me should you decide the time is now.
1074173	Ah Seeker, I had not thought to see you again in that form.  Perhaps you have difficulty finding the wise Darius?  I do not know where he wanders, but I can tell you that he is always curious, so perhaps you'll find him near a great curiousity?
1074174	*sniff* fish! much-fish!
1074175	Thiiirsty. Hurrr. Hurrr.
1074176	Ah, thus it ends.
1074177	*giggle* So pretty!
1074178	Sap of Sosaria
1074179	Well enough done.  It's best to kill quickly with respect so there isn't suffering.
1074180	Do you have them?  Let me see.
1074181	Has it been done?
1074182	Did you find it?
1074183	You there! I have a job for you.
1074184	Come here, I have work for you.
1074185	Hey you! Want to help me out?
1074186	Come here, I have a task.
1074187	Want a job?
1074188	Weakling! You are not up to the task I have.
1074189	Hey tough guy! I have a job, but I doubt you are up too it.  It requires someone far braver then you.
1074190	*sigh* Oh no. You won’t do at all.  Look at you, so weak, so puny.  Oh no no no.
1074191	Just keep walking away!  I thought so. Coward!  I’ll bite your legs off!
1074192	Ridiculous peasant!  I laugh in your general direction!  You are not up to my challenge!
1074193	You there! Yes you. Stop looking about like a toadie and come here.
1074194	You’re not Drithen! I should have known right away, just look at you. Oh well, you’ll have to do I guess...
1074195	You there, in the stupid hat!   Come here.
1074196	Excuse me! I’m sorry to interrupt but I urgently need some assistance.
1074197	Pardon me, but if you could spare some time I’d greatly appreciate it.
1074198	Might you lend a troubled soul some assistance?
1074199	Help! I need somebody! Won’t you please, please help me!
1074200	Thank goodness you are here, there’s no time to lose.
1074201	Waste not a minute! There’s work to be done.
1074202	It’s you!   I’m saved, you are just in time.
1074203	Hello friend. I realize you are busy but if you would be willing to render me a service I can assure you that you will be judiciously renumerated.
1074204	Greetings seeker.  I have an urgent matter for you, if you are willing.
1074205	Oh great adventurer, would you please assist a weak soul in need of aid?
1074206	Excuse me please traveler, might I have a little of your time?
1074207	Good day to you friend! Allow me to offer you a fabulous opportunity!  Thrills and adventure await!
1074208	I’d like to speak to an adventurer please. If I can have just a few minutes of your time, I’d like to offer you an exciting opportunity.
1074209	Hey, could you help me out with something?
1074210	Hi.  Looking for something to do?
1074211	I could use some help.
1074212	*yawn* You busy?
1074213	Hey buddy.  Looking for work?
1074214	Knave! Come here right now!
1074215	Don’t test my patience you sniveling worm!
1074216	You there!  Yes you, the simpleton wandering aimlessly.  Come here.
1074217	I want to make you an offer you’d be a fool to  refuse.
1074218	Hey!  I want to talk to you, now.
1074219	Hello there, can I have a moment of your time?
1074220	May I call you friend?  I have a favor to beg of you.
1074221	Greetings!  I have a small task for you good traveler.
1074222	Could I trouble you for some assistance?
1074223	Have you done it yet?  Oh, I haven’t told you, have I?
1074224	My ire has been appeased by your efforts.  You are deserving of this reward.
1074225	A noble deed you have done this day.  This reward is nothing to a hero such as yourself.
1074226	You have not disappointed me.  Enjoy your reward.
1074227	I am pleased to hear that you have abided by my wishes in this delicate matter.  Here is your recompense.

1074272	You have no way to lower yourself safely into the enormous sinkhole.
1074273	You must speak with Librarian Verity before you can donate to this collection.
1074274	You dance in the fairy ring, but nothing happens.
1074275	You are unable to push your way through the tangling roots of the mighty tree.
1074276	You press and push on the iron maiden, but nothing happens.
1074277	No admission without a ticket.
1074278	You realize that your eyes are playing tricks on you. That crate isn't really shimmering.

1074284	Friend of the Fey
1074285	It is true that a skilled arcanist can summon and dominate an imp to serve at their pleasure.  To do such at thing though, you must master the miserable little fiends utterly by demonstrating your superiority.  Rough them up some -- kill a few.  That will do the trick.
1074286	The children of Sosaria understand the dedication and committment of an arcanist -- and will, from time to time offer their friendship.  If you would forge such a bond, first seek out a goodwill offering to present.  Pixies enjoy sweets and pretty things.
1074287	You're probably right.  They're not worth the effort.
1074288	There's always time to make new friends.
1074289	Surely you're not having difficulties swatting down those annoying pests?
1074290	I think honey and some sparkly beads would please a pixie.
1074291	Hah!  You showed them!
1074292	What have we here? Oh yes, gifts for a pixie.
1074293	Token of Friendship

1074297	I've wrapped your gift suitably to present to a pixie of discriminating taste.  Seek out Arielle and give her your offering.
1074298	*giggle* Mean reapers make pixies unhappy.  *light-hearted giggle*  You could fix them!
1074299	Elven Leafweave
1074300	Now that you've shown those mini pests your might, you should collect suitable implements to use to train your summoned pet.  I suggest a stout whip.
1074301	Hunter's Garb
1074302	Now you just need to make the little buggers fear you -- if you can slay an arcane daemon, you'll earn their subservience.

1074310	I'll hold onto this gift in case you change your mind.
1074311	*giggle* Okies!
1074312	Maleki's Honor (Juggernaut Set)
1074313	Heh. Changed your mind, eh?
1074314	If you're not up for it, so be it.
1074315	Arielle wanders quite a bit, so I'm not sure exactly where to find her.  I'm sure she's going to love your gift.
1074316	Mean reapers are all around trees!  *giggle*  You fix them up, please.
1074317	Well, hurry up.  If you don't get a whip how do you expect to control the little devil?
1074318	You need to vanquish an arcane daemon before the imps will fear you properly.
1074319	*giggle*  Oooh!  For me?
1074320	*giggle* Mean reapers got fixed!  Pixie friend now! *giggle* When mean thingies bother you, a brave pixie will help.
1074321	That's a well-made whip.  No imp will ignore the sting of that lash.
1074322	You've demonstrated your strength, got a means of control, and taught the imps to fear you.  You're ready now to summon them.

1074357	Well, I don't mind saying it -- I'm flabbergasted!  Absolutely astonished.  I just heard that some elves want to convert themselves to humans through some magical process.  My cousin Nedrick does whatever needs doing.  I guess you could check it out for yourself if you're curious.  Anyway, I wonder if you'll bring my cousin, Drithen, this here treat my wife baked up for him special.
1074358	No reward is pending.
1074359	The reward would not fit in your pack.
1074360	You receive a reward: ~1_REWARD~
1074361	The reward could not be given.  Make sure you have room in your pack.
1074362	A reward is available!

1074365	A new creature has hatched overnight in the tank.
1074366	An unfortunate accident has left a creature floating upside-down.  It is starting to smell.
1074367	The tank looks healthier today.
1074368	The tank looks worse than it did yesterday.
1074369	The water looks clearer today.
1074370	This tank can use more water.
1074371	Brine shrimp have hatched overnight in the tank.
1074372	A mutant creature has hatched overnight in the tank.
1074373	A sea horse has hatched overnight in the tank.
1074374	You attack your enemy with the force of nature!
1074375	You are assaulted with great force!
1074376	Your enemy shrugs off the poisonous bite.
1074377	You allure the humanoid to follow and protect you.
1074378	The humanoid becomes enraged by your charming attempt and attacks you.
1074379	You cannot charm that!
1074380	This humanoid is already controlled by someone else.
1074381	You fire an arrow of pure force.
1074382	You are struck by a force arrow!
1074383	Your shot sends forth a wave of psychic energy.
1074384	Your mind is attacked by psychic force!

1074398	Seek Strongroot, the great treefellow, whose very roots reach to the heart of the world.  Seek Enigma, whose wisdom can only be conveyed in riddles and rhymes.  Seek Bravehorn, the great hart, who exemplifies the fierce dedication of a protector of his people.
1074399	Seek the Huntsman, the centuar tasked with maintaining the balance.  And lastly seek Arielle, the pixie, who has perhaps the most important lesson -- not to take yourself too seriously.
1074400	Or do none of these things.  You must choose your own path in the world, and what use you'll make of your existence.
1074401	You are bald!
1074402	Special Hair Dye
1074403	Greetings, traveler and welcome.
1074404	Perhaps you have heard of the service I offer?  Perhaps you wish to avail yourself of the opportunity I lay before you.
1074405	Elves and humans
1074406	Violent change marked the sundering of our ties.  We are different -- elves and humans.  And yet we are much alike.  I can give an elf the chance to walk as a human upon Sosaria.  I can undertake the transformation.
1074407	But you must prove yourself to me.  Humans possess a strength of character and back.  Humans are quick-witted and able to pick up a smattering of nearly any talent.  Humans are tough both mentally and physically.  And of course, humans defend their own -- sometimes with their own lives.
1074408	Seek Sledge the Versatile and learn about human ingenuity and creativity.  Seek Patricus and demonstrate your integrity and strength.
1074409	Seek out a human in need and prove your worth as a defender of humanity.  Seek Belulah in Nu'Jelm and heartily challenge the elements in a display of toughness to rival any human.
1074410	You have proven yourself capable and commited and so I will grant you the transformation you seek.
1074411	Or turn away and embrace your heritage.  It matters not to me.
1074412	You have made a good start but have more yet to do.
1074413	You must yet perform these deeds:
1074414	A sea horse
1074415	Brine shrimp
1074416	Elven Whitewood Walls
1074417	Heartwood Walls

1074432	Vacation days: ~1_DAYS~
1074433	Bound to the Land
1074434	Oh help! Help me!  I don't want to end up like my sisters, enslaved by the cruel Melisande.  I cannot flee, I am bound here by the evil of the harpy Saliva.  Won't you please help me and redeem my sisters at the same time?  I will grant you my blessing in return.
1074435	Please, I'm so frightened.  I don't want to become twisted and corrupt.  Please free me!
1074436	Until my sisters have been treated with mercy and released from their twisted existence and until the vile Saliva is slain, I cannot feel safe or bestow my blessing.
1074437	Oh!  You've returned.  I cannot thank you enough for saving me.  I only hope Melisande doesn't return them to life once more.  Bless you, fair adventurer. Bless you.  If you wish to face Melisande in battle, place the token of my blessing in the basket.  May you be triumphant and redeem us all through your efforts.
1074438	Misplaced
1074439	Shhh!  *nervous chuckle* Oh, sorry about that.  I forget that I'm not in the library any longer -- and instead that THING has taken over.  If that wasn't distressing enough, I've misplaced my thesis pages and they've been gathered up by the shambling dead.  Could you retrieve them for me?
1074440	Disintegrating Thesis Notes
1074441	*tense sigh* Of course, I understand.  If you change your mind, I'll be waiting.
1074442	Most of the creatures here wouldn't be interested in my thesis.  *nervous chuckle*  Master Gnosos would argue that no one is -- not even the undead.  Still, I'd wager that the more powerful undead have my pages.
1074443	Ah!  You've got my pages?  Oh no ... they've been damaged.  Here, take this key.  Perhaps you can find the podium and gain access to the library.  My poor books are being ravaged by that horror and you'd do well to put things right.
1074444	Wonders of the Natural World
1074445	Step right up!  Step right up!  Lords and Ladies, this is your opportunity to view the find of a lifetime!  What magical energy caused the fascinating play of light and darkness within these subterranean passageways?  What mysterious forces are at work deep within the Prism of Light?  Admission tickets are good for a full day of adventure and excitement and well worth the price at 10,000 gold. Whadda ya say?
1074446	C'mon now Lords and Ladies -- you're passing up the opportunity of a lifetime.  Is 10,000 gold too much to pay for your enlightenment?
1074447	Dig into those pockets Lords and Ladies!  Just ten-thousand-shiny-gold-coins and you'll be walking in the bootsteps of the famous Lord Denthe himself!
1074448	Step right up!  Thank you, enjoy the amazing caverns.
1074449	Dangerous Crossing
1074450	Ho there!  If you wish to cross and test yourself in the Blighted Grove, you'll need a special machete.  Luckily I have one right here and it's for sale!  Only 1,000 gold each.
1074451	Yah, you didn't like like you could handle it.  Probably just as well.
1074452	What kind of adventurer are you that you can't afford to outlay some gold on good equipment.  You'll need this machete to get under those roots.  It's a good price.
1074453	Best of luck!  Watch out for Lady Melisande.  She's a nasty one.
1074454	Watch Your Step
1074455	You won't be able to get into the sinkhole with any normal rope.  It's a big drop, sure, but the real problem is the acid and poison gas.  See, most ropes can't stand up to that kind of treatment, even for a short period of time.  So you'll need a special rope -- a magical rope. Like these ones I happen to have available here for a mere 5,000 gold each.
1074456	I sure don't want to go down there either.  You won't hear me chiding you. In fact, I commend your intellect.
1074457	The price isn't going to change.  It's 5,000 per rope please.
1074458	Be careful down there. I don't like losing customers.
1074459	That's okay, I'll find someone else to make the delivery.
1074460	If I knew where my cousin was, I'd make the delivery myself.
1074461	Oh, hello there.  What do you have for me?
1074462	The best thing about my job is that I do a little bit of everything, every day.  It's what we're good at really.  Just picking up something and making it do something else.  Listen, I'm really low on parts.  Are you interested in fetching me some supplies?

1074472	That poison would not be affected.
1074473	You pour the noxious liquid into the keg.
1074474	You decided that drinking this would be a bad idea.  However, drop this into a full keg of poison would increase the deadliness.

1074510	Do you have those power crystals?  I'm ready to put the finishing touches on my latest experiment.
1074511	You put the creature into a fish bowl.
1074512	You put the gasping creature into your pack.

1074519	Ho there!  There's nothing quite like a day's honest labor to make you appreciate being alive.  Hey, maybe you'd like to help out with this project?  These crates need to be delivered to Sledge.  The only thing is -- it's a bit of a rush job and if you don't make it in time, he won't take them.  Can I trust you to help out?
1074520	Crate for Sledge
1074521	Oh yah, if you're too busy, no problem.
1074522	Sledge can be found in Buc's Den.  Better hurry, he won't take those crates if you take too long with them.
1074523	Hey, if you have cargo for me, you can start unloading over here.
1074524	Oh!  I just don't know what to do.  My mother is away and my father told me not to talk to strangers ... *worried frown*  But my grandfather has sent word that he has been hurt and needs me to tend his wounds.  He has a small farm southeast of here.  Would you ... could you ... escort me there safely?
1074525	I hope my grandfather will be alright.
1074526	Grandfather's farm is a ways west of the Shrine of Spirituality. So, we're not quite there yet.  Thank you again for keeping me safe.
1074527	It's all about hardship, suffering, struggle and pain.  Without challenges, you've got nothing to test yourself against -- and that's what life is all about.  Self improvement!  Honing your body and mind!  Overcoming obstacles ... You'll see what I mean if you take on my challenge.
1074528	My way of life isn't for everyone, that's true enough.
1074529	You're not making much progress in the honing-mind-and-body department, are you?
1074530	Ahhhh!  Don't you feel great?  Struggle is good for the soul.
1074531	The first time you were born, you entered the world bare of all possessions and concerns.  So too as you transform to your new life as a human, you must remove all worldly goods from the touch of your flesh.
1074532	I call upon all nearby to witness your rebirth!
1074533	Fragment of a Map
1074534	The Ancient World
1074535	The lore of my people mentions Mondain many times.  In one tale, it is revealed that he created and enslaved a race -- a sort of man bull, known as a 'minotaur'.  The tales speak of mighty warriors who charged with blood-soaked horns into the heat of battle.  But, alas, the fate of the bull-men is unknown after the rupture.  Will you seek information about their civilization?
1074536	Warriors of the Gemkeeper
1074537	Here we honor the Gemkeeper's Apprentice and seek to aid her efforts against the humans responsible for the death of her teacher -- and the destruction of the elven way of life.  Our tales speak of a fierce race of servants of the Gemkeeper, the men-bulls whose battle-skill was renowned.  It is desireable to discover the fate of these noble creatures after the Rupture.  Will you seek information?
1074538	I am disappointed, but I respect your decision.
1074539	A traveler has told me that worshippers of Mondain still exist and wander the land.  Perhaps their lore speaks of whether the bull-men survived.  I do not think they share their secrets gladly.  You may need to be 'persuasive'.
1074540	I care not how you get the information.  Kill as many humans as you must ... but find the fate of the minotaurs.  Perhaps another of the Gemkeeper's servants has the knowledge we seek.
1074541	You have discovered an important clue!
1074542	What have you found?
1074543	The Golden Horn
1074544	Close Enough
1074545	Ah ha!  You see here ... and over here ... The map fragment places the city of the bull-men, Labyrinth, on that piece of Sosaria that was thrown into the sky.  Hmmm, I would have you go there and find any artifacts that remain that help tell the story.  But, legend speaks of a mighty barrier to prevent invasion of the city.  Take this map to Braen and explain the problem. Perhaps he can devise a solution.
1074546	Ah ha!  You see here ... and over here ... The map fragment places the city of the bull-men, Labyrinth, on that piece of Sosaria that was thrown into the sky.  Hmmm, I would have you go there and seek out these warriors to see if they might join our cause.  But, legend speaks of a mighty barrier to prevent invasion of the city.  Take this map to Canir and explain the problem. Perhaps she can devise a solution.<br>
1074547	Braen is nearby, run and speak with him.
1074548	Canir is nearby, run and speak with her.
1074549	Yes?  What do you want?  I'm very busy.

1074551	Taking the Bull by the Horns
1074552	Oh, I see. I will need some materials to infuse you with the essence of a bull-man, so you can fool their defenses.  The most similar beast to the original Baratarian bull that the minotaur were bred from is undoubtedly the mighty Gaman, native to the Lands of the Feudal Lords.  I need horns, in great quantity to undertake this magic.
1074553	Interesting.  I believe I have a way.  I will need some materials to infuse you with the essence of a bull-man, so you can fool their defenses.  The most similar beast to the original Baratarian bull that the minotaur were bred from is undoubtedly the mighty Gaman, native to the Lands of the Feudal Lords.  I need horns, in great quantity to undertake this magic.
1074554	Oh come now, don't be afraid.  The magic won't harm you.
1074555	I cannot grant you the ability to pass through the bull-men's defenses without the gaman horns.
1074556	You've returned at last!  Give me just a moment to examine what you've brought and I can perform the magic that will allow you enter the Labyrinth.
1074557	Gaman Horns
1074558	That doesn't look very appealing.
1074559	It looks unappetizing, but you're hungry...

1074574	What do you want?  Wonderful, another whining request for a refund on tuition.  You know, experiences like that are invaluable ... and infrequent.  Having the opportunity to test yourself under such realistic situations isn't something the college offers all students.  Fine. Fine.  You'll need to submit a refund request form in triplicate before I can return your 1,000,000 gold tuition.  You'll need to get some signatures and a few other odds and ends.

1074580	Is that my bucket? I had to ditch my favorite bucket when a group of ratmen jumped me!
1074581	Well hello there. Oh.  Wait a minute, you're not here to plead the case of that traitor Danoel are you?
1074582	Ah!  You found my property.  Thank you for your honesty in returning it to me.
1074583	Isn't that interesting?  Someone was willing to pay a lot of gold to see me gone.  You've earned a reward for bringing this to me.
1074584	You have discovered a private letter from the sorceress Minax to her dear friend "Travesty" that implicates some very important people in her pay.  Will you risk drawing attention to yourself by delivering the bundle to the castle in Britain?<br>
1074585	Probably a wise choice to keep a low profile.
1074586	It might be safest to deliver the letter to someone trustworthy that isn't too important.  Sarakki the Notary might be a good choice.
1074587	*smile* Greetings!  Oh ... oh my.  Oh, goodness ... *startled gasp*  Did you read ... we must report this at once.

1074607	Oh blast!  Not another of those forms.  I'm so sick of this endless paperwork.
1074608	You Scratch My Back
1074609	Heh.  Heheheh.  Good one.  You're not a Bedlam student and you're definitely not eligible for a tuition refund.  Heheheh. That old witch Aernya doesn't see as well as she used to you know.  Otherwise, she would have ... hmmm, wait a minute.  I sense a certain 'opportunity' here.  I'll sign your forms in return for a little help with a project of my own.  What do you say?

1074616	I'm something of a gourmet, you see.  It's tough getting some of the ingredients, though.  Bring me back some pixie legs, unicorn ribs and ki-rin brains and I'll sign your form.
1074617	Oh excellent, you're back.  I'll get the oven going.  That thing about pixie legs, you see, is that they burn and dry out if you're not really careful.  Taste just like chicken too!
1074618	Fooling Aernya
1074619	Now that I've signed your papers you'd better get back to that witch Aernya.  Mmmm mmm smell those ribs!
1074620	Giving up on your scheme eh?  Suit yourself.
1074621	You better hurry back to Mistress Aernya with that signed form.  The college only has so much money and with enough claims you may find yourself unable to get your tuition refunded.  *wink*
1074622	What?  Hrmph.  Gorrow signed your form did he?  Let me see that.  *squint*
1074623	Not Quite That Easy
1074624	I wouldn't be too smug just yet, whiner.  You still need Master Gnosos' signature before I can cut your refund.  Last I heard, he's coordinating the recovery of the portions of the college that are currently overrun.  *nasty smile*  Off with you.
1074625	Completed Tuition Reimbursement Form
1074626	Coward.
1074627	What are you waiting for?  The iron maiden is still the portal to Bedlam.
1074628	Made it through did you?  Did you happen to see Red Death out there?  Big horse, skeletal ... burning eyes?  No?  What's this?  Forms?  FORMS?  I'm up to my eyebrows in ravenous out-of-control undead and you want a signature?
1074629	Convince Me
1074630	I'm not signing any forms until the situation here is under control.  So, you can either help out or you can forget getting your tuition refund.  Which will it be?  Help control the shambling dead?
1074631	No signature for you.
1074632	No signature for you until you kill off some of the shambling dead out there and destroy that blasted horse.
1074633	Pulled it off huh?  Well then you've earned this signature!
1074634	Tuition Reimbursement
1074635	Well, there you are.  I've added my signature to that of Gorrow, so you should be set to return to Mistress Aernya and get your tuition refunded.
1074636	Great! If you're going to stick around here, I know we have more tasks for you to perform.
1074637	Just head out the main gates there and you'll find yourself embracing the iron maiden in the Bloodletter's Guild.
1074638	*disinterested stare*  What?  Oh, you've gotten your form filled in.  How nice.  *glare*  And I'd hoped you'd drop this charade before I was forced to rub your nose in it.  *nasty smile*  You're not even a student and as such, you're not eligible for a refund -- you've never paid tuition.  For your services, Master Gnosos has recommended you receive pay.  So here.  Now go away.

1074642	Suit yourself.
1074643	I can't pay a bounty if you don't bring bag the ears.
1074644	Here to collect on a bounty?
1074645	Dreadhorn
1074646	Can you comprehend it? I cannot, I confess.  The most pristine and perfect Lord of Sosaria has fallen prey to the blight.  From the depths of my heart I mourn his corruption
1074647	How can you not feel as I do?
1074648	The lush and fertile land where Dread Horn now lives is twisted and tainted, a result of his corruption.  The fey folk have sealed the land off through their magics, but you can enter through an enchanted mushroom fairy circle.
1074649	Thank you.  I haven't the words to express my gratitude.
1074650	You have discovered a blood-stained journal that details the adventures of Lord Denthe.  The pages make for fascinating reading, telling the tale of the great man's efforts to uncover the secrets of the Prism of Light.  Will you donate the journal to a library so others may hear the tale of Lord Denthe's final expedition?
1074651	Or, you could keep the journal for your private library.
1074652	The librarian in Britain would be glad of your donation of Lord Denthe's journal.
1074653	Shhhh!  What have YOU done to that book?  It's covered in ... is that blood?  *furious glare*  Let me see that.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Do you realize how important this journal is?  Here, take this for your trouble.
1074654	The most incredible tale has reached my ears!  Deep within the bowels of Sosaria, somewhere under the city of Nu'Jelm, a twisted creature feeds.  What created this abomination, no one knows ... though there is some speculation that the fumbling initial efforts to open the portal to The Heartwood, brought it into existence.  Regardless of it's origin, it must be destroyed before it damages Sosaria.  Will you undertake this quest?
1074655	Perhaps I thought too highly of you.
1074656	An explorer discovered the cave system under Nu'Jelm.  He made multiple trips into the place bringing back fascinating crystals and artifacts that suggested the hollow place in Sosaria was inhabited by other creatures at some point.  You'll need to follow in his footsteps to find this abomination and destroy it.
1074657	I am overjoyed with your efforts!  Your devotion to Sosaria is noted and appreciated.
1074658	Oh, the trauma!  *weeps loudly*  My lucky dagger has been lost.  It was given to me by my father, as a final gift before he died.  That blade has been an heirloom of my family for generations.  I must have it back.  *sniffles pathetically*  Please, find my lucky dagger.
1074659	*wailing cries* Then begone if you will not help a poor man in need.
1074660	*sniffles*  The dagger was stolen by some dishonest man.  Or perhaps I dropped it.  That doesn't matter though.  All that matters is that you find my dagger and return it.
1074661	You've found it?  My lucky dagger!
1074662	You look strong and brave, my friend.  Are you strong and brave?  I only ask because I am known to be too generous to those that find for me interesting -- things -- to use in my smithing.  What do you say?
1074663	*nods*
1074664	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those essences.
1074665	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those crystalline fragments.
1074666	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those icy hearts.
1074667	My friend, you've returned -- with items for me, I hope?  I have a generous reward for you.
1074668	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal daemons.
1074669	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.

1074671	These abominations must not be permitted to fester!
1074672	You must not waste time. Do not suffer these crystalline abominations to live.
1074673	You have done well.  Enjoy this reward.
1074674	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.

1074675	Primitive Fetish
1074676	Grobu's Fur
1074677	I've always been fascinated by primitive cultures -- especially the artifacts.  I'm a collector, you see.  I'm working on building my troglodyte display and I'm saddened to say that I'm short on examples of religion and superstition amongst the creatures.  If you come across any primitive fetishes, I'd be happy to trade you something interesting for them.
1074678	I don't really want to know where you get the primitive fetishes, as I can't support the destruction of their lifestyle and culture. That would be wrong.
1074679	Bravo!  These fetishes are just what I needed.  You've earned this reward.
1074680	I don't know if you can handle it, but I'll give you a go at it.  Troglodyte chief -- name of Lurg and his mangy wolf pet need killing.  Do the deed and I'll reward you.
1074681	A Trog and His Dog
1074682	The trog chief and his mutt should be easy enough to find.  Just kill them and report back.  Easy enough.
1074683	Not half bad.  Here's your prize.
1074684	New Cloak
1074685	I have created a masterpiece!  And all I need to finish it off is the fur of a bear.  But not just ANY bear -- oh no, no, that wouldn't do.  I've heard tales of a mighty beast, Grobu, who is bonded to the leader of the troglodytes.  Only Grobu's fur will do.  Will you retrieve it for me?
1074686	I've told you all I know of the creature.  Until you return with Grobu's fur I can't finish my cloak.
1074687	Ah! So soft, so supple.  What a wonderful texture.  Here you are ... my thanks.
1074688	Troglodytes!
1074689	Oh nevermind, you don't look capable of my task afterall.  Haha!  What was I thinking -- you could never handle killing troglodytes.  It'd be suicide.  What?  I don't know, I don't want to be responsible ... well okay if you're really sure?
1074690	Probably the wiser course of action.
1074691	You still need to kill those troglodytes, remember?
1074692	Some of the most horrific creatures have slithered out of the sinkhole there and begun terrorizing the surrounding area.  The plague creatures are one of the most destruction of the minions of Paroxysmus.  Are you willing to do something about them?
1074693	Vile creatures have exited the sinkhole and begun terrorizing the surrounding area.  The demons are bad enough, but the elementals are an abomination, their poisons seeping into the fertile ground here.  Will you enter the sinkhole and put a stop to their depredations?
1074694	The daemons that have congregated to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?
1074695	The moloch daemons that have congregated to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074696	The succubi that have congregated within the sinkhole to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074697	The arcane daemons that worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074698	You have discovered an acid covered strongbox.  Perhaps the owner would pay for its return before the corrosive substance destroys it.  Do you wish to return the box?
1074699	The box doesn't look like it will survive the acid for much longer anyway.
1074700	The steaming box is etched with the name of Aeluva.
1074701	The disintegrating strongbox belonged to Jelrice.
1074702	The acid damaged coffer is etched with the name 'Belulah'.
1074703	Hello.  Oh, what's that?  My trunk!  What happened to it?  Well nevermind that.  Thank you!  Here's payment for your trouble.
1074704	Please, please I beg of you ... help out of here.  I was trying to find one of my sheep that went missing and I fell down this hole.  Then these ... *hysterical weeping*.  Please, get me out of here!
1074705	Please!  PLEASE!  Don't let me die here.
1074706	*whimper* Please ... hurry.  I am a good climber and could get out the way you came in, if you can just get me there.
1074707	You've saved my life!  Oh thank you!  I can't repay you for your kindness but please, take this.
1074708	A Bad Seed
1074709	The plight of the forest is staggering, all the more so because some of the tainted creatures are reproducing.  I am working to develop a natural means to prevent these corrupted seedlings from taking root, but without samples of such seeds, I'm forced to guess wildly what might work.  Will you harvest some tainted bogling seeds for me?
1074710	I'm working on a striking necklace -- something really unique -- and I know just what I need to finish it up.  A huge fang!  Won't that catch the eye?  I would like to employ you to find me such an item, perhaps a snake would make the ideal donor.  I'll make it worth your while, of course.
1074711	Scale Armor
1074712	Here's what I need ... there are some creatures called hydra, fearsome beasts, whose scales are especially suitable for a new sort of armor that I'm developing.  I need a few such pieces and then some supple alligator skin for the backing.  I'm going to need a really large piece that's shaped just right ... the tail I think would do nicely.  I appreciate your help.
1074713	The Medallion
1074714	You have discovered an insciption on the back of the medallion that reads 'love always, your Belulah'.  Since the wearer of the necklace has met a grisly end, perhaps you'd be willing to track down Belulah?
1074715	You are already protected with this slimy ointment.
1074716	You are no longer under the protection of the slimy ointment.
1074717	Certain tamed animals are accepted as donations by transfering the pet to the collection box.
1074718	Tainted seeds please.  Look for the bigggest, meanest bogling you can find.
1074719	<CENTER>Food Decoration Tool</CENTER>
1074720	This is perfect!
1074721	Do you have it?  *gasp* What a tooth!  Here … I must get right to work.
1074722	Those really big snakes like swamps, I've heard.  You might try the blighted grove.
1074723	I understand.  I don't like snakes much either.  They're so creepy.
1074724	Hydras have been spotted in the Blighted Grove.  You won't get those scales without getting your feet wet, I'm afraid.
1074725	I can't wait to get to work now that you've returned with my scales.
1074726	A Tale of Tail
1074727	I've heard of you, adventurer.  Your reputation is impressive, and now I'll put it to the test. This is not something I ask lightly, for this task is fraught with danger, but it is vital.  Seek out the vile hydra Abscess, slay it, and return to me with its tail.
1074728	Well, the beast will still be there when you are ready I suppose.
1074729	Em, I thought I had explained already.  Abscess, the hydra, you know? Lots of heads but just the one tail.  I need the tail. I have my reasons. Go go go.
1074730	Ah, the tail.  You did it!  You know the rumours about dried ground hydra tail powder are all true?  Thank you so much!
1074731	Or you could keep the medallion instead.
1074732	The name 'Belulah' is the only clue you find on the medallion.
1074733	Greets!  How can I … oh.  Oh no!  Is that … my darling Thorvald!  *quiet weeping*  Thank you for your kindness in returning this to me.  It means … a lot.  *sniffle*
1074734	The hero returns from the glorious battle and - oh, such a small feather?
1074735	If you're going to get anywhere in the adventuring game, you have to take some risks.  A harpy, well, it's bad, but it's not a dragon.
1074736	The path to greatness isn't for everyone obviously.
1074737	I've seen how you strut about, as if you were something special. I have some news for you, you don't impress me at all. It's not enough to have a fancy hat you know.  That may impress people in the big city, but not here. If you want a reputation you have to climb a mountain, slay some great beast, and then write about it.  Trust me, it's a long process.  The first step is doing a great feat.  If I were you, I'd go pluck a feather from the harpy Saliva, that would give you a good start.
1074738	A Feather in Yer Cap
1074739	Guile, Irk and Spite
1074740	You know them, don't you.  The three?  They look like you, you'll see. They looked like me, I remember, they looked like, well, you'll see.  The three.  They'll drive you mad too, if you let them.  They are trouble, and they need to be slain.  Seek them out.
1074741	Drool
1074742	When I was a child I was savaged by a Cu'Sidhe.  It ran up and slobbered all over me. Long story short:  it was horrible, I was traumatized and I've never been the same since.  Look at me now.  Kill them, kill them all.  Well at least a few.
1074743	I don't think I'm asking anything unreasonable here.
1074744	Slaughter me some  -- Cu'Sidhe.  I'm a poet!
1074745	You just don't understand the gravity of the situation.  If you did, you'd agree to my task.
1074746	Perhaps I was unclear.  You'll know them when you see them, because you'll see you, and you, and you.  Hurry now.
1074747	Are you one of THEM?  Ahhhh!  Oh, wait, if you were them, then you'd be me.  So you're -- you.  Good job!
1074748	It's rare to find someone who shares my aversions and is willing to take immediate measures.  I'm glad we met.
1074749	Ha ha!  This just goes to prove that there's no request that someone is not willing to fuffilll.  Well done my friend!
1074750	Momento!
1074751	I was going to march right out there and get it myself, but no ... Master Gnosos won't let me.  But you see, that bridle means so much to me.  A momento of happier, less-dead ... well undead horseback riding.  Could you fetch it for me?  I think my horse, formerly known as 'Resolve', may still be wearing it.
1074752	Hrmph.
1074753	The bridle would be hard to miss on him now ... since he's skeletal.  Please do what you need to do to retreive it for me.
1074754	I'd know that jingling sound anywhere!  You have recovered my bridle.  Thank you.
1074755	Culinary Crisis
1074756	You have NO idea how impossible this is.  Simply intolerable!  How can one expect an artiste' like me to create masterpieces of culinary delight without the best, fresh ingredients?  Ever since this whositwhatsit started this uproar, my thrice-daily produce deliveries have ended.  I can't survive another hour without produce!
1074757	You have no artistry in your soul.
1074758	I must have fresh produce and cheese at once!
1074759	Those dates look bruised!  Oh no, and you fetched a soft cheese.  *deep pained sigh*  Well, even I can only do so much with inferior ingredients.  BAM!

Master Theophilus to you. He may have gone native but he still holds a Mastery Degree from Bedlam College!  But, well, that's neither here nor there.  I need you to take care of my colleague.  Convince him of the error of his ways.  He may resist.  In fact, assume he will and kill him.  We'll get him resurrected and be ready to cure his folly.  What do you say?
1074857	I understand.  A Master of Bedlam, even one entirely off his rocker, is too much for you to handle.

1074955	Sub Contracting
1074956	Heya!  I'm sure glad to see you.  Listen I'm in a bit of a bind here.  I'm supposed to be gathering poisoned water at the base of that corrupted tree there, but I can't get in under the roots to get a good sample.  The branches and brush are so tainted that they can't be cut, burned or even magically passed.  It's put my work at a real standstill.  If you help me out, I'll help you get in there too.  Whadda ya say?
1074957	This is some nasty stuff, that's for certain.  I don't even want to think about what sort of blight caused this venomous reaction from that old tree.  Let's get to work … we'll need to try something really hard but still workable as our base material.  Nothing's harder than stone and diamond.  Let's try them first.
1074958	Hmm, I've never even heard of something that can damage diamond like that.  I guess we'll have to go with plan B.  Let's try something similar.  Sometimes there's a natural immunity to be found when you use a substance that's like the one you're trying to cut.  A sort of "sympathetic" thing.  Y'know?
1074959	Amazing!  The bark was reduced to ash in seconds.  Whatever this taint is, it plays havok with living things.  And of course, it took the edge off both diamonds and granite even faster.  What we need is something workable but dead
1074960	We're in business!  I've put together the instructions for chopping sort of sword, in the style of one of those new-fangled elven machetes.  Take those back to Jamal for me, if you would.
1074961	Wonderful!  Now we can both get in there!  Let me show you these instructions for making this machete.  If you're not skilled in smithing, I'm not sure how much sense it will make though.  Listen, if you're heading in there anyway … maybe you'd do me one more favor?  I'm ah ... buried in work out here ... so if you'd go in and get me a few water samples, I'd be obliged.
1074962	A step closer to entering Blighted Grove.
1074963	(10) workable samples
1074964	Okay.  If you change your mind, I'll probably still be stuck here trying to get in.
1074965	Sure, no problem.  I thought you were interested in figuring this out.
1074966	Well, okay.  I guess I thought you'd want to see this through.
1074967	Oh.  Right, I guess you're really ... ah ... busy too.
1074968	My friend, Iosep, is a weaponsmith in Jhelom.  If anyone can help us, he can!
1074969	If you're a miner, you should have no trouble getting that stuff.  If not, you can probably buy some samples from a miner?
1074970	I think a lumberjack can help supply bark.
1074971	I'm thinking we need something fairly brittle or it won't hold an edge.  And, it can't be alive, of course.
1074972	I'm sure Jamal is eager to get this information.  He's probably still hanging around near that big old blighted tree.
1074973	Once you're inside, look for places where the water has twisted and warped the natural creatures.

1075070	The rusty gate cracks open as you step through...
1075071	The Gift of Renewal has faded.
1075072	<h2>Fawn</h2><br>This unusual village is named after its founding queen, Lady Fawn. Renowned for her lovely appearance, she held beauty as the one true trait of value. In her honor, the town quickly adopted the same belief. Though Lady Fawn has since died, her rather superficial values continue on. A port town, Fawn's main sources of income are the various sea-based occupations, including ship building and fishing.
1075073	<h2>Moon</h2><br>During the Third Age of Darkness, Moon was a city full of mages
1075074	<h2>Yew</h2><br>Within a valley of thick forest, Yew is one of the land's major trading centers of wood. During the Third Age of Darkness, the Stranger visited Yew and learned the secrets of the Great Earth Serpent. This allowed the Stranger to free the serpent that was blocking their ship from reaching the home of Exodus, the Isle of Fire. Some say that freeing the serpent has caused an imbalance in the cosmos, but that could be drunken wizards telling tales.
1075075	<h2>Devil Guard</h2><br>Devil Guard is a city in Sosaria that was totally enclosed by the Great Mountains during the Third Age of Darkness, and was only reachable by the magical gate. After the destruction of Exodus, a cavernous tunnel had torn through the mountain, providing an alternate route. Ancient legends tell of a castle that fell from the sky, crashing into the mountains and creating the valley in which Devil Guard was eventually built.
1075076	<h2>Montor</h2><br>Montor is a vast city in Sosaria, where courage is especially upheld, having all the shops needed for the warrior. The inhabitants of the Montors knew a lot about the mystical Four Cards that the Stranger needed to defeat Exodus, as well as tales of the lost shrines of Ambrosia. Montor is the most popular city, and also the largest in Sosaria.
1075077	<h2>Death Gulch</h2><br>The village of Death Gulch, situated on an island on the east side of Sosaria and only reachable by ship, was a hive of darkness and corruption during the Third Age of Darkness. It now provides a small haven for those seeking respite from the sea.
1075078	<h2>Grey</h2><br>The inhabitants of Grey, during the Third Age of Darkness, gave several clues to the Stranger that defeated Exodus. It was even said that they even sold ships that could fly to the stars, but none can be found within its borders. Legends say the Stranger flew to the stars and altered time and reality, causing a castle to fall backwards in time and crash into the land of ancient Sosaria.
1075079	<h2>Britain</h2><br>This is the capital city of Sosaria and the home of Lord British. Lord British's magnificent castle is situated at the northern part of the city, overlooking Britanny Bay. This tall building is the greatest architectural structure of the new age. Loyal subjects pay homage to His Majesty, and renew fealty whenever they are in the vicinity of his castle. Rumors in taverns speak of a dark secret below the castle, so dark that not even the citizens can see it.
1075080	<h2>Sosaria</h2><br>Sosaria is a vast land, that had many feuding city states. Because of this continual conflict, the land grew bitter and warlike. It wasn't until The Third Age of Darkness that Sosaria's people were united, through the common threat known as Exodus. When the The Stranger destroyed Exodus, Sosaria became safe once again for those that remain in civilized areas. Many adventurers, however, now seek their fame and fortune. They believe that within the many dungeons, there is much treasure left behind for the taking. Only the brave seek out the ruins for riches.

1075312	I was born and raised in Buc’s Den. Have you been there? Then you know what a lawless place it is. Five years ago, my mother and father were killed by brigands there. I was only a child, and so I was sent here to live with my uncle.<br>Recently, a man moved into town, and I’m sure this man is the one who killed my parents. The sheriff will do nothing, he doesn’t believe me. What can I do? I’m no warrior. I can’t use magic. I don’t have the courage to avenge my family. Please, if you have any love at all for justice, I beg of you, seek out and slay this criminal!
1075313	Amulet of Righteousness
1075314	Why? This man has killed many innocent people. Would you let him walk around, free?
1075315	This brigand, Gregorio, you can find him in the farmland to the east of town. He usually wears a red skull cap and carries a pitchfork.
1075316	He is dead, then? Good! I can think of no one more deserving. Thank you for your help. I feel that a great weight has been lifted from me. Here, I would like you to take this necklace. It belonged to my mother. She said it has some magic, but I have never been able to discover how it works. Perhaps you can.

1075322	My father died in an accident some months ago. My mother refused to accept his death. We had a little money set by, and she took it to a necromancer, who promised to restore my father to life. Well, he revived my father, all right, the cheat! Now my father is a walking corpse, a travesty . . . a monster. My mother is beside herself -- she won't eat, she can't sleep. I prayed at the shrine of Spirituality for guidance, and I must have fallen asleep. When I awoke, there was this basin of clear water. I cannot leave my mother, for I fear what she might do to herself. Could you take this to the graveyard, and give it to what is left of my father?
1075323	Aurelia's gratitude.
1075324	Oh! Alright then. I hope someone comes along soon who can help me, or I don’t know what will become of us.
1075325	My father - or what remains of him - can be found in the graveyard northwest of the city.
1075326	What is this you give me? A basin of water?
1075327	Aemaeth
1075328	You tell me it is time to leave this flesh. I did not understand until now. I thought: I can see my wife and my daughter, I can speak. Is this not life? But now, as I regard my reflection, I see what I have become. This only a mockery of life. Thank you for having the courage to show me the truth. For the love I bear my wife and daughter, I know now that I must pass beyond the veil. Will you return this basin to Aurelia? She will know by this that I am at rest.
1075329	Mirror of Purification
1075330	You won’t take this back to my daughter? Please, I cannot leave until she knows I am at peace.
1075331	My daughter will be at my home, on the east side of the city.
1075332	Thank goodness! Now we can honor my father for the great man he was while he lived, rather than the horror he became.

1075337	Save His Dad
1075338	My father, Andros, is a smith in Minoc. Last week his forge overturned and he was splashed by molten steel. He was horribly burned, and we feared he would die. An alchemist in Vesper promised to make a bandage that could heal him, but he needed the silk of a dread spider. I came here to get some, but I was careless, and succumbed to their poison. Please, won’t you help my father?
1075339	Hurry! You must get the silk to Leon the Alchemist quickly, or it will crumble and become useless!
1075340	Oh . . . that’s your decision . . . OooOoooOOoo . . .
1075341	Thank you! Deliver it to Leon the Alchemist in Vesper. The silk crumbles easily, and much time has already passed since I died. Please! Hurry!
1075342	How may I help thee? You have the silk of a dread spider? Of course I can make you a bandage, but what happened to Frederic?
1075343	A Father’s Gratitude
1075344	That is simply terrible. First Andros, and now his son. Well, let’s make sure Frederic’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain. Will you take the bandages to his father? You can probably deliver them faster than I can, can’t you?
1075345	Andros’ Gratitude
1075346	Well I’m sorry to hear you say that. Without your help, I don’t know if I can get these to Andros quickly enough to help him.
1075347	I don’t know how much longer Andros will survive. You’d better get this to him as quick as you can. Every second counts!
1075348	Sorry, I’m not accepting commissions at the moment. What? You have the bandage I need from Leon? Thank you so much! But why didn’t my son bring this to me himself? . . . Oh, no! You can't be serious! *sag* My Freddie, my son! Thank you for carrying out his last wish. Here -- I made this for my son, to give to him when he became a journeyman. I want you to have it.

1075356	Aargh! It’s just not right! It doesn’t capture the unique color of her hair at all! If only I had some Prismatic Amber. That would be perfect. They used to mine it in Malas, but alas, those veins ran dry some time ago. I hear it may have been found in the Prism of Light. Oh, if only there were a bold adventurer within earshot who would go to the Prism of Light and retrieve some for me!
1075357	The joy of contributing to a noble artistic effort, however paltry the end product.
1075358	Is there no one who can help a humble artist pursue his Muse?
1075359	You can find Prismatic Amber in the Prism of Light, located just north of the city of Nujel'm.
1075360	I knew it! See, it’s just the color I needed! Look how it brings out the highlights of her wheaten tresses!
1075361	Gentle Blade
1075362	I came to this place looking for a cure for my wife. But I’m getting ahead of myself -- my wife was attacked by a werewolf, and survived. Now she has become a werewolf herself. My research has turned up nothing that would cure her affliction. *Sob* She begged me to end her suffering, but I cannot. She has removed herself to a remote part of Ice Island so that she does not endanger others. If I give you the means, will you go there, find her, and give her the mercy of a clean death?
1075363	Misericord
1075364	I understand. I am no warrior, either. I suppose I shall have to wait here until one comes along.
1075365	My wife is hiding out in a cave on the north end of Ice Island. You will not be able to harm here, even with the weapon I gave you, until night falls and she transforms into a wolf.
1075366	Thank you my friend . . . I know she is at peace, now. Here, keep the weapon. Most of its power is expended, but it remains somewhat potent against wolf-kind.
1075367	Unfading Memories
1075368	Finished! With the pigment I was able to create from the Prismatic Amber you brought me, I was able to complete my humble work. I should explain. Once, I loved a noble lady of gentleness and refinement, who possessed such beauty that I have found myself unable to love another to this day. But it was from afar that I admired her, for it is not for one so lowly as I to pay court to the likes of her. You have heard of the fair Thalia, Lady of Nujel'm? No? Well, she was my Muse, my inspiration, and when I heard she was to be married, I lost whatever pitiful talent I possessed. I felt I must compose a portrait of her, my masterpiece, or I would never be able to paint again. You, my friend, have helped me complete my work. Now I ask another favor of you. Will you take it to her as a wedding gift? She will probably reject it, but I must make the offer.
1075369	The Artist’s gratitude.
1075370	Alright then, you have already helped me more than I deserved. I shall find someone else to undertake this task.
1075371	The wedding is taking place in the palace in Nujel'm. You will likely find her there.
1075372	I’m sorry, I’m getting ready to be married. I don’t have time to . . . what’s that you say?
1075373	Unfading Memories
1075374	Emilio painted this? It is absolutely wonderful! I used to love looking at his paintings, but I don’t remember him creating anything like this before. Would you be so kind as to carry a letter to him? Fate may have it that I am to marry another, yet I am compelled to reveal to him that his love was not entirely unrequited.
1075375	Bleach
1075376	Very well, then. If you will excuse me, I need to get ready.
1075377	Take the letter back to the Artist’s Guild in Britain, if you would do me this kindness.
1075378	She said what? She thinks what of me? I . . . I can’t believe it! All this time, I never knew how she truly felt. Thank you, my friend. I believe now I will be able to paint once again. Here, take this bleach. I was going to use it to destroy all of my works. Perhaps you can find a better use for it now.
1075379	Doughty Warriors
1075380	Youngsters these days! Sorry, I didn’t introduce myself. I’m Kane, the Master of Arms for this city. This lot of trainees I got, they’re not worth a bucket of sour spit. You know the invasion some years back? Well, some of these pups weren’t even born then! What I need is an example, something that will put some steel into their spines. You seem pretty tough, what do you say to helping me out?
1075381	Show them what a real warrior is made of!
1075382	Ah. I see. Never mind then.
1075383	You’ll find mongbats all over the place. They’re a real pest. Once you’ve killed ten of them, come back and see me again.

1075392	Honest Beggar
1075393	Beg pardon, sir. I mean, madam. Uh, can I ask a favor of you? I found this jeweled ring.  Most people would sell it and keep the money, but not me. I ain't never stole nothing, and I ain't about to start. I tried to take it over to Brit castle, figgerin' it must belong to some highborn lady, but the guards threw me out. You look like they might let you pass. Will you take the ring over there and see if you can find the owner?
1075394	Find the ring’s owner.
1075395	I see. Too good to help an honest beggar like me, eh?
1075396	A jewel like this must be worth a lot, so it must belong to some noble or another. I would show it around the castle. Someone’s bound to recognize it.
1075397	Didst thou find my ring? I thank thee very much! It is an old ring, and a gift from my husband. I was most distraught when I realized it was missing.
1075398	Regina’s Thanks
1075399	What’s that you say? It was a humble beggar that found my ring? Such honesty must be rewarded. Here, take this packet and return it to him, and I will be in your debt.
1075400	Transparent Heart
1075401	Hmph. Very well. What did you say his name was?
1075402	Take the packet and return it to the beggar who found my ring.
1075403	What? For me? Let me see . . . these sapphire earrings are for you, it says. Oh, she wants to offer me a job! This is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me!
1075404	Doughty Warriors
1075405	You did great work. Thanks to you, my puppies are training harder than ever. I think they could actually take a mongbat now. I’m still worried they’ll slack off, though. What say you to slaying some Imps for me now? Show them how it’s really done?
1075406	Show them what a real warrior is REALLY made of!
1075407	You’re pretty sad. When I was a young warrior, I wasn’t one to walk away from a challenge.
1075408	You won’t find many imps on this continent. Mostly, they’re native to Ilshenar. Might be a few up around the hedge maze east of Skara Brae, though.
1075409	Hah! I knew you were up to the challenge.
1075410	Doughty Warriors
1075411	You’ve really inspired my trainees. They’re working harder than ever. I’ve got one more request for you, and it’s a big one. Those mongbats didn’t pose a problem. You mowed down the imps with no trouble. But do you dare take on a couple of daemons?
1075412	Sash of Might
1075413	What? You’re not scared of a couple of lousy daemons, are you?
1075414	There’s all kinds of daemons you can kill. There are some near the hedge maze, and some really powerful ones in Dungeon Doom.
1075415	Thanks for helping me out. You’re a real hero to my guards. Valor is its own reward, but maybe you wouldn’t mind wearing this sash. We don’t give these out to just anyone, you know!
1075416	The Honor of the De Boors
1075417	I beg your pardon, but will you listen to my story? My family, the de Boors family, have been jewel traders as far back as anyone can remember. Alas, by the time I was born, we had fallen on hard times. <br>To survive, I have had to sell much of my family’s property. Most of it was meaningless, but I regret that a few years ago I made a terrible mistake. I pawned a shield bearing my family’s coat of arms to a loan shark. That shield was borne into battle by Jaan de Boors, the founder of our house! It has no value to anyone, but that blackguard won’t believe I have no money. He wants a fortune in jewels before he will return it.<br>Now I have learned that I am dying. Soon I will be gone, and my lineage with me. For the sake of what little honor is left to me and my family name, I cannot bear to leave our ancestral shield in the hands of that villain. Will you help me recover it?<br>
1075418	Gather them quickly. Who knows how long Derek has to live?
1075419	I know how much I am asking. Please, can you not help a dying man restore his family’s honor?
1075420	Are you sure? You are very kind. Many of the monsters around here, when slain, are found to have jewels in their stomachs. From innocents they have eaten, no doubt.
1075421	You have done it! Bless you! I do appreciate this very much! Though, will you do me one last favor?
1075422	Jack the Villain
1075423	Will you take the jewels to the loan shark? I am not well enough to go myself, though it is not far.
1075424	Deliver the bag of jewels to the loan shark.
1075425	Ah well. You have already helped me by gathering the jewels. I cannot complain.
1075426	The name of the villain is Jack, you will find him over by the port.
1075427	What do you want? Oh, that jewel merchant wants his shield back, eh?
1075428	Saved Honor
1075429	That idiot! This beat up piece of junk isn’t worth more than three gold coins, four at most! Oh, well, a deal’s a deal!
1075430	Goblet of Celebration
1075431	I don’t care what you do!
1075432	Go away and never come back.
1075433	My shield! My family’s honor! You have my gratitude. Please, take this goblet. It is small enough repayment for all you have done for me, but it is the only thing of my family’s that I have left.

1075464	You already have as many of those as you need.
1075466	Ah yes, you over there. Come here.<br>You seem a bit puzzled.<br>It happens to nearly everyone that comes through here. <br>You see, you've been here before. In a way we all came from this place. <br>Still puzzled? Let me explain further.
1075467	Long ago, we existed as one society. <br>Then came that fateful day when Mondain's quest for power led to the destruction of the Gem of Immortality.<br>Now we live in worlds that closely resemble one another but we remain apart physically and spiritually.<br>But sometimes there's a shift, and people like you and I are able to pass through to one of the other realities. This reality.
1075468	Let me show you around your new home. <br>Look closely at the crystal ball before you.<br>It will transport you to places that will become part of your future. <br>I will remain with you only in spirit. <br>You may see others like yourself, but they will not be able to see you. <br>Ready to see Britannia?
1075469	This is Britain, the largest city of Britannia.<br>More precisely, you're standing outside Britain's main bank.<br>Town centers, such as this bank, are likely places to find what, or who, you are looking for. <br>And when you can't find a needed item, you may be able to craft it.
1075470	This is Haven. See that forge over there? Most cities have at least one.<br>The blacksmiths here sell simple armor and weapons but you'll learn how to craft better versions.<br>One day you may decide to become a tailor or an alchemist or maybe even a renowned carpenter.<br>Your bank vault may not have enough room to hold all of your wares so you'll need something a bit larger to store your possessions.
1075471	You're standing in Luna, the Knight city.<br>The buildings lining the walls of this city are houses owned and customized by the citizens of Britannia.<br>As you can see, some homeowners are masterful architects. Others prefer to spend their time dragon hunting and erect more simplistic abodes.<br>Homeowners may even hire personal vendors to sell wares from their home.<br>Some houses become famous for the design and the history surrounding them.
1075472	This is the Hedge Maze, or at least part of it.<br>It was built by Relvinian, a powerful, but mad magician who was fascinated by demons.<br>Some of his experiments are still alive, waiting for the next victim to reach the center of the maze.<br>Nobody is certain what happened to Relvinian. His disappearance remains a mystery to this day.<br>But enough of that.
1075473	This waterfall is within the walls of the city of Zento, the main city of the Tokuno Islands.<br>Tokuno is home to Ninja and Samurai, as well as many mystical creatures.<br>The Tokuno Islands were once a part of a much larger landmass called the Land of the Feudal Lords.<br>A spell of protection was cast over what was left of the land after its near destruction. It remained hidden until recently.<br>Now it has once again become part of this world.<br>Speaking of rejoining our world, let's visit the Heartwood.
1075474	Heartwood was not kept hidden, it has always been central to this world.<br>But methods of traveling into the heart of this tree were broken when the gem was shattered.<br>Heartwood is home to the Elves of Sosaria. Their culture is different, but we are learning to live together again.<br>Mostly.<br>You see, there remains a sect still loyal to Mondain.<br>They call themselves the Cult of the Fallen. <br>You may read more about them as you look further into the history of Britannia.
1075475	And this leads us to our final destination on your tour. <br>And perhaps a revelation or two.<br>You are standing in the center of Doom, one of the most dangerous places in Britannia.<br>You are safe for now, but beware should you return.<br>The abominations here won't be as tolerant next time. Nor will I.
1075476	Years ago, in a time before the Gem was shattered, we could have been friends and companions.<br>Now I am trapped by the very fragments of that destroyed promise while you are still free to roam the world.<br>We are not enemies, but you have what I seek. Your freedom shall become mine.<br>That is why I brought you across the shards when the opportunity arose.
1075477	I am patient and can wait for you to master both the sword and wand.<br>And then our duel shall be etched into history.<br>Now it is time for you to learn. <br>Train, become strong and prepare. Study the ways carefully.<br>Plan for the day we will meet and face each other.<br>Until then, good day.
1075478	Baker's Dozen
1075479	You there! Do you know much about the ways of cooking? If you help me out, I'll show you a thing or two about how it's done. Bring me some cookie mix, about 5 batches will do it, and I will reward you. Although, I don't think you can buy it, you can make some in a snap! First get a rolling pin or frying pan or even a flour sifter. Then you mix one pinch of flour with some water and you've got some dough! Take that dough and add one dollop of honey and you've got sweet dough. add one more drop of honey and you've got cookie mix. See? Nothing to it! Now get to work!
1075480	Argh, I absolutely must have more of these 'cookies!' Come back if you change your mind.
1075481	Thank you! I haven't been this excited about food in months!
1075482	Truth be told, the only way to get a feel for the bow is to shoot one and there's no better practice target than a sheep. If ye can shoot ten of them I think ye will have proven yer abilities. Just grab a bow and make sure to take enough ammunition. Bows tend to use arrows and crossbows use bolts. Ye can buy 'em or have someone craft 'em. How about it then? Come back here when ye are done.
1075483	Fair enough, the bow isn't for everyone. Good day then.
1075484	Return once ye have killed ten sheep with a bow and not a moment before.
1075485	Well done!  I prepared this bag for thee. Take it, and I wish thee the best of luck in thy endeavors.

Find a mortar and pestle, a good amount of black pearl, and ten empty bottles to store the finished potions in. Just use the mortar and pestle and the rest will surely come to you. When you return, the favor will be repaid.
1075489	Fine fine, off with *cough* thee then! The next time you see a lizardman though, give him a whallop for me, eh?
1075490	Just remember you need to use your mortar and pestle while you have empty bottles and some black pearl. Refresh potions are what I need.
1075491	*glug* *glug* Ahh... Yes! Yes! That feels great! Those lizardmen will never know what hit 'em! Here, take this, I can get more from the lizards.

Just use the bowcrafting kit while you have the other things, and I'm sure you'll figure out the rest.

Just get some of ingots and a hammer and use it over here at this forge. You can always buy ingots at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine yer own. You can either make a smith's hammer yerself if ya have the tinkering skill, or buy it from a tinker at the market. I need a few more bucklers hammered out to fill this here order with...  hmmm about ten more. that'll give some taste of how to work the metal.

1075518	Hail friend, hast thou a moment? A mishap with a saw hath left me in a sorry state, for it shall be a while before I canst return to carpentry. In the meantime, I need a comfortable chair that I may rest. Could thou craft a straw chair?  Only a tool, such as a dovetail saw, a few boards, and some skill as a carpenter is needed. Remember, this is a piece of furniture, so please pay attention to detail.

1075520	Are you sure you wish to leave this guided tour? You will not be able to return.
1075521	Clean Shaven
1075522	Oh how I wish I had a fancy dress like the noble ladies of Castle British! I don't have much... but I have a few trinkets I might trade for it. It would mean the world to me to go to a fancy ball and dance the night away. Oh, and I could tell you how to make one! You just need to use your sewing kit on enough cut cloth, that's all.
1075523	A Stitch in Time
1075524	an old ring
1075525	an old necklace
1075526	Won't you reconsider? It'd mean the world to me, it would!
1075527	Hello again! Do you need anything? You may want to visit the tailor's shop for cloth and a sewing kit, if you don't already have them.
1075528	It's gorgeous! I only have a few things to give you in return, but I can't thank you enough! Maybe I'll even catch Uzeraan's eye at the, er, *blushes* I mean, I can't wait to wear it to the next town dance!
1075529	Have a pickaxe? My supplier is late and I need some iron ore so I can complete a bulk order for another merchant. If you can get me some soon I'll pay you double what it's worth on the market. Just find a cave or mountainside and try to use your pickaxe there, maybe you'll strike a good vein! 5 large pieces should do it.
1075530	More Ore Please
1075531	Not feeling strong enough today? Its alright, I didn't need a bucket of rocks anyway.
1075532	Hmmm… we need some more Ore. Try finding a mountain or cave, and give it a whack.
1075533	I see you found a good vien! Great!  This will help get this order out on time. Good work!
1075534	'Tis a riddle, you see! "What kind of clock is only right twice per day? A broken one!" *laughs heartily* Ah, yes *wipes eye*, that's one of my favorites! Ah... to business. Could you fashion me some clock parts? I wish my own clocks to be right all the day long! You'll need some tinker's tools and some iron ingots, I think, but from there it should be just a matter of working the metal.
1075535	A clockwork puzzle
1075536	Wonderful! Tick tock, tick tock, soon all shall be well with grandfather's clock!
1075537	Chop Chop, On The Double!
1075538	That's right, move it! I need sixty logs on the double, and they need to be freshly cut! If you can get them to me fast I'll have your payment in your hands before you have the scent of pine out from beneath your nostrils. Just get a sharp axe and hack away at some of the trees in the land and your lumberjacking skill will rise in no time.
1075539	Ahhh! The smell of fresh cut lumber. And look at you, all strong and proud, as if you had done an honest days work!

1075543	Do you know anything about 'Inscription?' I've been trying to get my hands on some hand crafted Recall scrolls for a while now, and I could really use some help. I don't have a scribe's pen, let alone a spellbook with Recall in it, or blank scrolls, so there's no way I can do it on my own. How about you though? I could trade you one of my old leather bound books for some.

1075546	Hmm, thought I had your interest there for a moment. It's not everyday you see a book made from real daemon skin, after all!
1075547	Inscribing... yes, you'll need a scribe's pen, some reagents, some blank scroll, and of course your own magery book. You might want to visit the magery shop if you're lacking some materials.
1075548	Ha! Finally! I've had a rune to the waterfalls near Justice Isle that I've been wanting to use for the longest time, and now I can visit at last. Here's that book I promised you... glad to be rid of it, to be honest.

1075556	Ello there, looking for a good place on the dock to fish? I like the southeast corner meself. What's that? Oh, no, *sighs* me pole is broken and in for fixin'. My grandpappy gave me that pole, means a lot you see. Miss the taste of fish though... Oh say, since you're here, could you catch me a few fish? I can cook a mean fish steak, and I'll split 'em with you! But make sure it's one of the green kind, they're the best for seasoning!

1075559	Eh? Find yerself a pole and get close to some water. Just toss the line on in and hopefully you won't snag someone's old boots! Remember, that's twenty of them green fish we'll be needin', so come back when you've got em, 'aight?
1075560	Just a moment my friend, just a moment! *rummages in his pack* Here we are! My secret blend of peppers always does the trick, never fails, no not once. These'll fill you up much faster than that tripe they sell in the market!

1075674	Hail! Care to join our efforts for the Rise of Britannia?
1075675	Greetings my friend! My name is Gareth, and I represent a group of citizens who wish to rejuvenate interest in our kingdom's noble heritage. 'Tis our belief that one of Britannia's greatest triumphs was the institution of the Virtues, neglected though they be now. To that end I have a set of tasks prepared for one who would follow a truly Humble path. Art thou interested in joining our effort?
1075676	Wonderful! First, let us see if thou art reading from the same roll of parchment as we are. *smiles*
1075677	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.

1075695	With Love and Truth
1075696	Through a bounty of Truth, Love, and Courage
1075697	Through the absence of virtue

1075710	...that pride is evil.
1075711	...the path to true glory.
1075712	...that “I” am not “great”.
1075713	Ah... no, that is not quite right. Truly, Humility is something that takes time and experience to understand. I wish to challenge thee to seek out more knowledge concerning this virtue, and tomorrow let us speak again about what thou hast learned.<br>
1075714	Very good! I can see that ye hath more than just a passing interest in our work. There are many trials before thee, but I have every hope that ye shall have the diligence and fortitude to carry on to the very end. Before we begin, please prepare thyself by thinking about the virtue of Humility. Ponder not only its symbols, but also its meanings. Once ye believe that thou art ready, speak with me again.
1075715	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075716	Community Service - Museum
1075717	'Tis time to help out the community of Britannia. Visit the Vesper Museum and donate to their collection, and eventually thou wilt be able to receive a replica of the Shepherd's Crook of Humility. Once ye have it, return to me. Art thou willing to do this?
1075718	Very well, ye hath much work to do.
1075719	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075720	Hello my friend. The museum sitteth in southern Vesper. If ye go downstairs, ye will discover a small donation chest. That is the place where ye should leave thy donation.
1075721	Terrific! The Museum is a worthy cause. Many will benefit from the inspiration and learning that thine donation hath supported.
1075722	Community Service – Zoo
1075723	Now, go on and donate to the Moonglow Zoo. Givest thou enough to receive a 'For the Life of Britannia' sash. Once ye have it, return it to me. Wilt thou continue?
1075724	Good, thine path awaits
1075725	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075726	Hello again. The zoo lies a short ways south of Moonglow. Close to the entrance thou wilt discover a small donation chest. That is where thou shouldest leave thy donation.
1075727	Wonderful! The Zoo is a very special place from which people young and old canst benefit. Thanks to thee, it can continue to thrive.
1075728	Community Service – Library
1075729	I have one more charity for thee, my diligent friend. Go forth and donate to the Britain Library and do that which is necessary to receive a special printing of ‘Virtue’, by Lord British. Once in hand, bring the book back with ye. Art thou ready?
1075730	Impressive, thou art determined.
1075731	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075732	Art thou having trouble? The Library lieth north of Castle British's gates. I believe the representatives in charge of the donations are easy enough to find. They await thy visit, amongst the many tomes of knowledge.
1075733	Very good! The library is of great import to the people of Britannia. Thou hath done a worthy deed and this is thy last required donation. I encourage thee to continue contributing to thine community, beyond the obligations of this endeavor.
1075734	Who's Most Humble
1075735	Thou art challenged to find seven citizens spread out among the towns of Britannia: Skara Brae, Minoc, Britain, and one of the towns upon an isle at sea. Each citizen wilt reveal some thought concerning Humility. But who doth best exemplify the virtue? Here, thou needeth wear this plain grey cloak, for they wilt know ye by it. Wilt thou continue?
1075736	Excellent. When thou hast satisfied the needs of the most humble, thou wilt be given an item meant for me. Take this <B>brass ring</B> to start ye on the way.
1075737	'Tis a difficult quest, but well worth it. Wilt thou reconsider?
1075738	There art no less than seven 'humble citizens' spread across the Britannia proper. I know that they can be found in the towns of Minoc, Skara Brae and Britain. Another may be upon an island at sea, the name of which escapes me at the moment. Thou needeth visit all seven to solve the puzzle. Be diligent, for they have a tendency to wander about.<BR><BR><br>Dost thou wear the plain grey cloak?
1075739	A horse blanket would offer more comfort than thine cloak, mayhaps.
1075740	Hello friend. Yes, I work with yon horses each day. I carry bails of hay, feed, and even shovel manure for those beautiful beasts of burden. Everyone who rideth my animals enjoy their temperament and health. Yet, I do not ask for any recognition.
1075741	All I need is but a simple ~1_desire~.
1075742	If I ever receive that which I need, I wilt gladly trade it for this ~1_gift~.
1075743	Ah, thank you! This ~1_desire~ is just what I needed. Please taketh this ~2_gift~ - I hope it will be of use to thee.
1075744	The cloak thou wearest looks warm.
1075745	Good tidings to thee. I live on scraps in the shadow of Lord British's Castle. I am so close to nothing, that surely, thou canst not help but see I live a humble life.
1075746	One ~1_desire~ wilt make my life so much nicer.
1075747	I have no need for this ~1_gift~. For the right item, I would trade it.
1075748	*gasp* A ~1_desire~, 'tis perfect. I doth have plans for this. Here, I have no need for this ~2_gift~ now.
1075749	I doth have a similar cloak.
1075750	Greetings. I tend my flock and provide guidance to my fellow citizens. I seek not a life full of profit. For to strive for personal recognition or social position is not a worthy cause. A humble man is happy with his place.
1075751	All that I needest is a ~1_desire~.
1075752	I useth this ~1_gift~ not at all. If ye bringeth me the right item, I would make a trade.
1075753	Ah, ‘tis a perfect ~1_desire~. Please take this ~2_gift~ in trade.
1075754	You, in the grey cloak, art thou hungry?
1075755	I feedeth any who come here with the means to pay.  Be they noblemen or commoners, peaceful or aggressive, artist or barbarian, tis not my place to judge. I believeth there is value in everyone, and thus serve all.
1075756	All that I wilt ask for, is a ~1_desire~.
1075757	This ~1_gift~ was given to me and I cannot use it. I wilt happily trade it for the right item.
1075758	Thanks to thee! This ~1_desire~ is just right. Here, this ~2_gift~ is for thee.
1075759	Art thou hiding under that cloak?
1075760	Greetings, friend. Didst thou know I work all day, preparing and storing all sorts of meat? My cleaver is not dainty or at all particular, but if ye bringeth something to me then I will render it useful for food. Every creature can be thought of as useful in life... or in death. Death comes to us all, my friend. I hath learned that, for certain, in this humble profession.
1075761	Speaking of useful, if ye findeth me a nice ~1_desire~, I wilt be grateful.
1075762	I received this ~1_gift~ as a gift. I hath no need for it, but wert ye to bring me something interesting, I would trade it, perhaps.
1075763	Thou broughtest me a ~1_desire~! That will do nicely. Here, take this ~2_gift~ as thanks.
1075764	Thou looketh like a fellow healer in that cloak.
1075765	I am the sort of person who wandereth the countryside for weeks, my friend. All that time I spend healing good people who art in need of my services. All of this done without any reward, save the knowledge that I leadeth a life of virtue.
1075766	I have my needs, however.  A ~1_desire~ would certainly help me.
1075767	This ~1_gift~ was sent to me by mistake, I wouldest like to trade it for what I need.
1075768	A ~1_desire~! Many thanks to thee. Please accept this ~2_gift~.
1075769	That grey cloak is very nice.
1075770	Greetings to thee, friend! Art thou on some sort of quest? Ye have that look about ye, and that cloak looks somewhat familiar. Ah, no matter. A break from my blacksmithing work is always welcome! I canst only talk for a little while though, there are a few things I promised to have done for the township today. After all, a community is much like a long chain, and we can only be as stronger as our weakest link!
1075771	I do have a humble desire or two, though. I seem to have trouble finding a ~1_desire~.
1075772	Wonderul!  A ~1_desire~!  Surely thou hast gone through much trouble to bring this for me. Please take this iron chain that I made for Gareth. ‘Tis something we once talked of for some time, and he had suggested a new method of metalworking that I have only just accomplished.
1075773	Aha! Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for. What think ye of Sean? Of all those I have met, he is the least concerned with others' opinions of him. He excels at his craft, yet always believes he has something left to learn. *looks at the iron chain necklace* And it shows, does it not?

1075782	Noble friend, thou hast performed tremendously! On behalf of the Rise of Britannia I wish to reward thee with this golden shield, a symbol of accomplishment and pride for the many things that thou hast done for our people.<BR><BR><br>Dost thou accept?
1075783	*smiles* Surely thy deeds will be recognized by those who see thee wearing this shield! It shall serve as a reminder of the exalted path that thou hast journeyed upon, and I wish to thank thee on behalf of all whom thine efforts shall benefit. Ah, let us not forget that old cloak I gavest thee - I shall take it back now and give thee thine reward.
1075784	*smiles* I understandeth thy feelings, friend. Ye shall remain anonymous then, to all those who shall benefit from thine efforts.<BR><br>Yet, through all these trials, perhaps thou hast come a little closer to understanding the true nature of Humility.<br>Thine efforts might seem small compared to the great world in which we live, but as more of our people work together, stronger shall our people be.<BR><BR><br>I wish for ye to keep the cloak I gave thee earlier. Thou canst do with it what thou will, but I hope that it shall serve as a reminder of the days ye spent engaged in our simple cause.<br>And although I have nothing more for thee, I wouldest exhort ye to continue upon this path, always seeking opportunities to humble thyself to the demands of the world.<br>There is a small island to the south upon which lies the Shrine of Humility. Seek solace there, and perhaps the answers to thine questions will become clear.

1075986	Make a statement in your living room, a statement that says, I like my furniture to squeal when I sit on it. These handsome, handcrafted pieces are made of the bleached white bones of victims of various diseases, wars, tragedies and accidental deaths. Some of these bones still have a little life left in them.<br>
1075987	The art you hang in your home tells the world who you are. If you hang these three paintings, you are telling the world that you have a heart of cold black evil. Created by Sosaria’s most disturbed painters, these three works of haunted art include: Lycanthropy, The Watcher and Withering Beauty. Watch them closely, as each has its own way of watching you.
1075988	No time to hunt for those annoyingly elusive Pixies? No problem! Mount these five real pixies on your trophy wall, their faces frozen in terror-filled grimaces. Delightful! And they squeal and beg and cry when you poke them. Tons of fun for the whole family!
1075989	Stretch out on this gorgeous bed of razor sharp nails. Think of it as free acupuncture. Ignore the blood that seeps from your flesh as you sleep. The nails are rust proof.
1075990	When you pass in front of this mirror, you find that your reflection is paler, greener and well, more ghostly than you remember. Could it be you need more iron in your diet? More sun maybe? But wait, that’s not you at all. That’s just the nightmarish apparition that visits your mirror when you glance into it. And why does he have so many insulting things to say to you?
1075991	This is not only the perfect altar for sacrificing valuables to the dark gods, it’s also a wonderful trash disposal unit. Whenever you put an item on the altar, a flame rises and consumes whatever is upon it.

1076008	Welcome the the humble abode of ~1_OWNER_TITLE~ ~2_OWNER_NAME~, please remove your shoes, and have a seat where you may find one.
1076009	Ahh, greetings to ~1_VISITOR_TITLE~ ~2_VISITOR_NAME~. Your coming here was foreseen, and I alone know of your purpose.
1076010	*squints* Not you again! Fine, fine... whatever... come on in, I suppose. *sighs*

1076015	Death Inverted is the door that will not close, the old habit that returns to repeat a lesson. A transition, but perhaps not to the state you need.
1076016	The Inverted Wheel does not spin. There is no movement to propel you in the direction you need to go. You may feel off your path, or unable to push ahead.
1076017	Inverted Justice seeks fairness, honesty, but truth is difficult to find. You may be unwilling to consider all options or unwilling to accept responsibility for your actions.
1076018	The Inverted Fool lacks the faith to begin a journey. You may not be ready to start anew. You may fear, based on past experience, to trust what you will find on this new path.
1076019	The Inverted Hanged Man has not found conclusion
1076020	The Inverted High Priestess is active in events where she should be more passive. Perhaps you cannot pull back to view the bigger picture objectively. You may be too involved.
1076021	The Inverted Magus seeks, but has not yet found, his inner power. You may be distracted or your goals may not be clear enough. You may not be able to focus your energy in a clear direction.
1076022	The Inverted Star is uninspired. The light at the end of the tunnel may not be as bright as you had hoped. Could bring a mild calming, but not true serenity.
1076023	The Inverted Tower represents a sudden upheaval, a breakthrough on the horizon. An experience may not humble you as you need. A realization may be just out of reach.
1076024	The Inverted World does not fulfill. Accomplishments may not be as great as they seemed they would be. You may not have quite what they expected.

1076052	Clicking "OK" will create a Personal Attendant contract bound to you. You will not be able to trade it to another player, and only you will be able to use it.
1076053	You already have an attendant.
1076054	Welcome to this humble marketplace. If you need any assistance ~1_OWNER_TITLE~ ~2_OWNER_NAME~ will be glad to help you.
1076055	Come Friend! Enter ~1_OWNER_TITLE~ ~2_OWNER_NAME~'s wondrous shop of many things! If you can't find it here, I suggest you go somewhere else!
1076056	*Looks ~1_VISITOR_NAME~ over with narrowed eyes, scowling, and points to the sign on the wall* "Reagents for spell casting only, Please do not eat!"
1076057	The Fool stumbles headlong, blind, into danger, not seeing the consequences. You are starting on a new path. Trust that you will find your way.
1076058	The Magus knows of his potential. He acts with focus, without distractions, and can be a powerful creative force, centered on producing the results he wants. Direct your talents to make what is possible reality.
1076059	The High Priestess is inactive, passive, allowing things to take their own path. She is intuitive, and trusts herself, her dreams and her imagination. Be open to the bigger picture. Let events unfold as they may.
1076060	The Wheel of Fortune shows a turning point. Allow yourself to get swept up in events. Be involved, aware and have a greater perspective.
1076061	Justice shows respect for fairness, honesty and ethics. Consider all sides of an issue. Seek balance in the decision to come. Accept responsibility for your decisions.
1076062	The Hanged Man is at the end of his struggle
1076063	Death is an ending, the closing of a door. The past is behind you. Shed old habits, and eliminate what is unnecessary. It also represents a transition, a humbling experience that will allow you to reach new heights.
1076064	The Tower is the release, the sudden upheaval. You may experience a crisis, or a breakthrough. It is often humbling, toppling from the heights of ones ego, but can be a revelation as well.
1076065	The Star represents inspiration, renewed hope for the future. It is the light at the end of the tunnel. The Star can be generous, opening the heart to give to others, with such actions bringing peace and serenity.
1076066	The World is fulfillment, the state of accomplishment, the realization of your goals. Your experiences combining into your whole self. This is when your dreams come true.

1076238	Again, 'you' of this plane attempt to make use of a simple invocation of magical energy.
1076239	By what name do 'you' wish to be addressed at this time?
1076240	Very well, '~1_name~.' Do 'you' have memory of previous discussions with 'myself?'
1076241	Good. Tedious repetition should then be unnecessary on this occasion.
1076242	So be it. 'I' must often repeat information when conversing with the life of Britannia, it seems.
1076243	Those which 'you' know of as 'wisp' in Britannia are projections of life in Xorinia.
1076244	However, these 'wisp' are weaker projections, as 'your' plane is a variant of the prime.
1076245	Xorinia serves as a conduit for information between different planes.
1076246	Do 'you' wish to exchange information?
1076247	'I' will wait while 'you' supply a reasonably dense source of information.
1076248	Then 'I' will initiate cessation of proximity between 'us.'
1076249	When 'you' have prepared information of interest contact 'me' again.
1076250	In accordance with 'your' custom: Goodbye, '~1_name~.'

1076374	Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure
1076375	Hubert the Lion was haughty and vain
1076376	And especially proud of his elegant mane.
1076377	But conceit of this sort isn't proper at all
1076378	And Hubert the Lion was due for a fall.
1076379	One day as he sharpened his claws on a rock
1076380	He received a most horrible, terrible shock.
1076381	A flaming hot spark flew up into the air,
1076382	Came down on his head and ignited his hair.
1076383	With a roar of surprise he took off like a streak,
1076384	Away through the jungle to Zamboozi Creek.
1076385	He leaped in kersplash! with a shower of bubbles,
1076386	And came bobbing up with a head full of stubbles.
1076387	At first he just stared with a wide-open mouth
1076388	At the cloud of black smoke drifting off to the south.
1076389	Then he felt with his paws just in back of his ears
1076390	And he suddenly realized the worst of his fears.
1076391	'I'm ruined,' he shouted, oh what'll I do! I'd rather be dead or go live in a zoo!'
1076392	'And if anyone sees me, oh what a disgrace, So I'd better discover a good hiding place!'
1076393	Oh, but I told it just a bit ago... mayhaps later?
1076394	'Tis very spacious! It containeth the royal throne, a commemorative shield, and the Serpent Crest.
1076395	Many a day and eve my lord sat there upon... *teehee* Yet it hath such an odd shape!
1076396	Oh yes, not like those from Magincia or Nujel'm 'tall!
1076397	The red one over on yonder wall. It hath a wonderful inscription, but I do not know who Govannon Mac Lyr was
1076398	May Truth Be My Sword, Courage My Shield, And Love Guide Them Both. It speaketh well of the Three Principles
1076399	The silver serpent stands boldly 'pon the red field, a symbol of strength for all!
1076400	A truly magical creature, rarely seen in these modern times
1076401	I hath but seen one once, yet now know why my liege feeleth so strongly of their power and dignity
1076402	Oh it's so pretty! I had forgotten how peaceful a place it could be
1076403	'Twas once reserved for only the finest of horses for the Royal Guard, yet now anyone canst purchase a steed therein
1076404	Hmm, I wonder what 'twas built for...
1076405	*teehee* Sometimes I sneak through the walls to fetch a quick snack. The guards sometimes leave out rations
1076406	They art quite kind, yet mostly stern in their duties
1076407	Most of these nobles visit from far away places, like Magincia or Moonglow. Some are very friendly!
1076408	We hath the finest cooks in all of Britannia here! Yep!
1076409	I eat there every day, I highly recommend the brie!
1076410	The nobles get odd looks upon their faces if I go there during meals... so I eat in the kitchen
1076411	'Tis a wonderful library full of rare books and histories. A pity I am so small, or I would read more!
1076412	Lord British once slept in that very room! It also hath a secret!
1076413	Uh-huh! And we would read stories before bedtime, 'twas wonderful! I sleep on a pillow near the bed
1076414	The good Commander leant it to me, 'twas most kind!
1076415	If thou examineth the north wall most carefully, ye should find the entrance to milord's study!
1076416	Oh, but please be careful therein, the castle staff oft forget to clean it methinks
1076417	Many of the land's finest artists come here to paint portraits
1076418	Be veryyy careful in there! Nystul used to make things explode all the time! Clainin is no better!
1076419	I asked Clainin what happened to him... but no one seemeth to have a good answer for me
1076420	He's nice, but I miss the funny old man!
1076421	'Tis so big! I used to sit in 'pon many a meeting between Lord British and his Council
1076422	Aye, there is a council of Lords and Ladies that manage the kingdom in my lord's... absence
1076423	The Commander gave me a fluffy pillow!
1076424	Oh! Would you like to know about the castle? I can tell you about its history or even the layout!
1076425	This isn't the first castle, of course! 'Tis built upon the remains of older castles as the kingdom grew
1076426	Oh yes! The foundations are buried right beneath us! I once explored some of the passages
1076427	Yes, quite a few are intertwined with the castle's sewer, but people are too big to fit!
1076428	'Tis separate from the city's, yet almost as complex!
1076429	Well, wouldst thou like to know more about the grounds or the inside?
1076430	I think the most interesting things are the garden, stables, barracks, blacksmithing, training area, or that odd tower
1076431	'Tis behind the castle's southwest wing. There was a time when it bustled with activity!
1076432	One of Britannia's finest smithys, I canst not count how many of our guards wear the Order shields forged there
1076433	Oh, there's the throne room, dining hall, kitchen, meeting hall, studio, laboratory, library, and my lord's bedroom
1076434	My liege, the sovereign ruler of Britannia, yet he hath gone...
1076435	I know not where, but I shall wait for him!
1076436	Now the Council rules in his stead
1076437	Oh, well, 'tis been a hard time for Britannia, yet the Council seemeth able to stay the course
1076438	Lord British has been Britannia's ruler since its inception
1076439	Our proud country's borders extend across the waves! E'en be it Trammel or Felucca, many call it home
1076440	This land was brought about by Lord British and Nystul, to stay a horrible evil brought upon us by Minax
1076441	Our homeland, from which many fled as Minax's armies laid waste to the kingdom...
1076442	I hope she rots.
1076443	May his name be cursed for ever and ever, 'tis his fault that so many troubles were wrought upon my lord
1076444	With the shards of the Gem and... oh, I do carry on don't I?
1076445	I canst not even comprehend that strange and horrible being
1076446	After all, who shall read me stories?
1076447	Yes! My lord read me many a story from a strange and wonderful land called... 'Urth?' I think 'twas.
1076448	My favorite is about 'Hubert the Lion'
1076449	Wouldst thou like to hear the story?
1076450	Lord British once drew a map of it, I wonder what happened to it? It had many countries
1076451	That's a silly way to pronounce it!
1076452	He told me he wast named after his birth place, how odd!
1076453	The world which we know was once Sosaria, but now is one kingdom
1076454	Aye! Rule, Britannia!
1076455	After the Stranger defeated Mondain, my lord bound together the shattered remnants of our world into one kingdom
1076456	I often wonder what happened to him... so I wrote a book when I found out!
1076457	Hast thou read, 'My Story?' It recordeth many a strange thing about our world
1076458	Oh yes, there were once many kingdoms in Sosaria, Lord British himself united several in his early days
1076459	Akalabeth and the Lands of the Lost King became the Lands of Lord British, and the capital of Akalabeth became Britain
1076460	Lord British was given the title 'Champion of the White Light,' and drove Mondain from these lands for a great time
1076461	Truth, Love and Courage - from which flow all the Eight Virtues
1076462	Ver!
1076463	Amo!
1076464	Cor!
1076465	Oh! So few know the mantra of the Axiom of Infinity! How wonderful!
1076466	Veramocor!
1076467	Aye, 'tis represented in this very castle!
1076468	Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility
1076469	Ahm!
1076470	Mu!
1076471	Ra!
1076472	Beh!
1076473	Cah!
1076474	Summ!
1076475	Om!
1076476	Lum!
1076477	I'm Sherry!
1076478	Yes?
1076479	Oh! You said it right!
1076480	Hehe, I write books, eat cheese, and talk to people
1076481	I love cheese! Dost thou have any?
1076482	Some people think 'tis an odd thing, but I'm even trying to learn new languages!
1076483	Aye! One day I wish to be able to talk to every intelligent race in the world
1076484	Oh, for some time I hath been traveling, seeking answers
1076485	I canst not tell thee more, for I am sworn to secrecy
1076486	Aye! I am a mouse!
1076487	... I'm sorry to see what happened to him
1076488	I... I canst not tell thee of that
1076489	*Squeak*
1076490	*Squeek*
1076491	*Squirk*
1076492	*Squeak, squirk?*
1076493	*Squeeeeeek!*
1076494	*Eeeek!*
1076495	*Nitters fiblik*
1076496	Ne'er have I seen such a grim game as the one played that eve. For every move there was found a counter!
1076497	A pawn for a pawn, a knight for a knight, and then the field was left with naught but lonely kings.
1076498	And alone, neither could overturn the other...
1076499	The very air was torn asunder, as though the air had been peeled away. Beyond it lay darkness and stars
1076500	T'were not unlike the night sky, yet deeper and more ethereal
1076501	I never wish to feel such a thing again!
1076502	The Time Lord's voice penetrated me to the core. Didst he know I was there, that I and Blackthorn both witnessed this?
1076503	I know something of the nature of worlds, yet in what kind of place canst one such as the Time Lord dwell?
1076504	Lord British told me of it, how such an artifact of evil could be created I darest not imagine.
1076505	Thou knowest then, that our world is but a shadow of another Britannia.
1076506	Perhaps it is the wrong word? Yet we are not the true Britannia, and for this my lord is gone...
1076507	I... understand the price that would have been paid. Yet they tell me my lord found another way
1076508	Long after Blackthorn's death, though. Oh how such a horrible fate could be visited on such a noble man!
1076509	All life that was unique to our world, gone! Erased as though it had never existed?
1076510	I pray the protections that shield our own shard remain strong
1076511	No ill fate awaits our world now should the people embrace the virtues. Yet, they do not!
1076512	He seemeth to be an entity from beyond our own dimension, tasked with watching the multiverse
1076513	Our world is not alone, for there are thousands upon thousands reflections of the original Britannia
1076514	After the Gem was shattered, each shard kept a likeness of the world within it. Such was its power!
1076515	Yes, yet, save that night in Lord British's chambers, I hath not seen him. Perhaps he is somehow limited?
1076516	Nystul once spoke of a barrier surrounding our shard, as though it blocked outside interferences
1076517	Perhaps the barrier canst be breached?
1076518	Oh! Excuse me, I must be going
1076519	Sorry! I have to be going
1076520	It's breakfast time!
1076521	I'm off for Lunch!
1076522	Dinnertime!
1076523	I'm getting a little sleepy... good night!

1076697	I am a being known to thy people as the Time Lord
1076698	Indeed, I am tasked to watch over worlds, ensuring their safe passage through the ether
1076699	A void that is not a void, it exists outside of existence - as ye know it at least
1076700	It is a difficult concept to comprehend. I am at once outside thy world, yet am here in it
1076701	I do not visit worlds like these often, for I find myself limited to the corporeal form
1076702	It is a limit placed upon me by the nature of this shard's existence
1076703	I will not deceive thee, there are many worlds like thine, all of which are in peril
1076704	Verily, where thou standest was once sacrosanct, yet is now seen by all
1076705	I destroyed the foul creatures who had entered through the rifts, for I can do that at least
1076706	It is for this reason I have come, to learn more of the ethereal tears forming here
1076707	I am knowledgable, but not omniscient. If thou hast information, I shall listen at a later time
1076708	For now, I must go
1076709	Worlds beyond thine own refer to this place as but one shard amongst many
1076710	To ye they must seem as nightmares incarnate, they are beasts of the Void
1076711	Think of it not as the absence of everything, but as the absence of nothing

1076798	*hic*
1076799	‘Cause the court ordered me.
1076800	A fate, I believe, that will be bound by Justice. Thank you.
1076801	A friend of the defendant?
1076802	A game played by politicians and liars (as though the two could be separate!)
1076803	A man who fled to safety, never warning those left behind of the horrors following after him.
1076804	A man who's arrogance, who's unmitigated gall, who's foolhardy quest for glory and riches so infuriated the Ophidians that they poured war down upon us.
1076805	A thousand things contributed to this war - the Scion’s Zenith was just one of them.
1076806	A trial by fire burns the beast!
1076807	Ah, *hic*, ah, yes Your Honor, I am present.
1076808	Ah, and could you tell me a little about Papua? Before the invasion, I mean.
1076809	Ah, hiccups, Your Honor, just a tad nervous.
1076810	Ah, well, then. Carry on.
1076811	Ah.
1076812	Aha! Did you hear that everyone!?
1076813	All may be seated.
1076814	All rise!
1076815	All rise! Hear ye, hear ye!
1076816	All this was shattered one horrible morning... In a single instant everything she'd held dear was ripped away from her.
1076817	All those having anything to do before the Honorable Verina, Justice of the Court of Truth, draw near and attend.
1076818	Always a pleasure.
1076819	An army that would soon overwhelm Papua’s pitiful defenses, and march on towards our heartland.
1076820	And because that many other like Cases of Treason may happen in Time to come, which a Man cannot think nor declare at this present Time
1076821	And finally, ask thyself,  “If it were I in Ricardo’s place, how wouldst I wish to be treated?”
1076822	And how have you defined this instance of High Treason?
1076823	And we appreciate it. My lord, has the Royal Council considered the charges of treason against Ricardo?
1076824	And ye were up in some tree looking down, is that right?
1076825	And yes, my friends, this was well beyond the Kingdom’s borders.
1076826	And you just sat there?
1076827	Are you familiar with the Scion’s Zenith?
1076828	Art thou prepared to open?
1076829	As is the Court. Didst thou have any further witnesses?
1076830	Ask thineselves,  “Is it possible that an entire war could begin with the actions of just one man?”
1076831	Ask thineselves, “Is it reasonable that a man should be put to death for committing a crime he couldst not know would harm another?"
1076832	At any time.
1076833	Aye, ‘tis a beautiful little town, sitting on the shore surrounded by jungle.
1076834	Aye, that’s them.
1076835	Aye. Aye… Saw the innkeeper’s girl run into the old shipwright’s. She’d been in the weaponsmith’s - had something in her hand.
1076836	Bailiff! Escort this man from the building!
1076837	Bailiff, take this man away.
1076838	Be patient. Continue Mr. Casca.
1076839	Be seated, please.
1076840	Be seated.
1076841	Beauregard of Trinsic, for the Defense.
1076842	Because they’re afraid you’ll discover the truth. And the truth is this:
1076843	Both of my representatives have proven useless to me. Both were provided by the government, which also tries me.
1076844	Britannia lays claim to all of the Lost Lands.
1076845	Britannia versus Ricardo.
1076846	But I cannot.
1076847	But one thing I can tell you is the Truth.
1076848	But they were too fast. And then the big ‘uns, the ones with the blood-stained bardiches…
1076849	But wait, I’m not… I’m f…
1076850	But we cannot show mercy.
1076851	By the authority vested in the Royal Council, ruling pro-tempore, and by the Treason Act.
1076852	By what authority do you judge this crime High Treason?
1076853	Can you truly say all that Ricardo has wrought is ill?
1076854	Can you truly say that Ricardo has done nothing good for the Kingdom?
1076855	Casca of Heartwood as the Plaintiff, representing the government of Britannia.
1076856	Claim? Do our laws extend to the Ophidians?
1076857	Come! Stop! Go!
1076858	Conspiracy, in the attempted assault upon a Kingdom prisoner transport unit.
1076859	Could the clerk please read the summary of findings?
1076860	Could the clerk please read the various conditions for which High Treason is defined?
1076861	Could you define the meaning?
1076862	Could you tell me about what happened when the Ophidian army invaded your town?
1076863	Court dismissed.
1076864	Court shall recess for one Britannian hour.
1076865	Court will recess for twenty Britannian minutes!
1076866	Court will reconvene in one Britannian hour.
1076867	Decide his fate! Don’t be late! Kekeke.
1076868	Did I murder a Brood Queen at the behest of some noble in Britain? No.
1076869	Did I send wave after wave of invading marauders into the Ophidians lair seeking treasure? No.
1076870	Did we not turn over a replicated copy, which they readily accepted, convinced of its realness?
1076871	Did we see the Ophidians withdraw after that peaceful move?
1076872	Did you listen carefully? That’s right. They, the Royal Council, are allowed to define Treason however they wish.
1076873	Did you see anything while you were up there?
1076874	Do you know where he got it?
1076875	Does the Defense wish to accede?
1076876	Dost thou wish to explain?
1076877	Er, did Ricardo tell you where he obtained the crown?
1076878	Er, well, yes Your Honor.
1076879	Er, yes, Your Honor.
1076880	Even after the so-called crime has been committed, as they have done to me.
1076881	Excuse me?
1076882	Finally, I would like to call Luiz the Guard to the stand, who will testify concerning the assault on Ricardo’s transport earlier this month.
1076883	For the ramifications could be dire.
1076884	Forgive me, my friends, for this graphic rendition.
1076885	Forgive me, Your Honor.
1076886	Four, Kill any member of the Royal Court
1076887	Fourth, that the theft of the Scion’s Zenith was an instigating factor in the sudden uprising of the Ophidians.
1076888	Friends, Britannians, Countrymen!
1076889	Get this fool woman out of here!
1076890	Good afternoon, Your Honor.
1076891	Good afternoon, Your Honor. Might I say Her Ladyship looketh well today?
1076892	Good afternoon. The clerk shall announce counsel.
1076893	Guards!
1076894	Guilty.
1076895	Has Ricardo’s crime met these conditions?
1076896	Have you ever met this man, Ricardo?
1076897	Have you reached a verdict on the charge?
1076898	He committed a crime, and, through his negligence, compounded the crime in an incalculable way.
1076899	Heard it came from the snake people.
1076900	Hehehehe.
1076901	Her father was an innkeeper, and as such, she often had the opportunity to greet travelers and serve as a hostess for their visitors.
1076902	Here… alone, in shock, drenched in tears and sweat and blood, the poor girl hid.
1076903	Hey, Nick.
1076904	High Treason, for inciting the Ophidian War.
1076905	His actions have resulted in the deaths of thousands, and extraordinary loss to the Kingdom.
1076906	Hmm… Save for the serious nature of the charges I might have already ordered this case retried.
1076907	How are we to know it was not all a lie? A mere excuse?
1076908	How can I have stolen something, when the Ophidians do not recognize our own laws?
1076909	How could I, by myself, have incited a war when the "crime" I committed was so minor?
1076910	How do you find the defendant?
1076911	How so?
1076912	How, ye may ask, might a man, a thief, in fact, be innocent?
1076913	Hudson, are you from the town of Papua?
1076914	I agree, Your Honor and…
1076915	I am a necessary sacrifice. I am the scapegoat: the man who suffers their sins.
1076916	I am Francesco, Treasurer of the Royal Council. I am here representing their will today.
1076917	I am handing a copy of the Treason Act to the clerk at this time.
1076918	I cannot tell you. I doubt they will ever tell you.
1076919	I did, in fact, take the Scion’s Zenith from the Ophidians. Please notice I did not say “stole.”
1076920	I did.
1076921	I do not understand the cunning ways of law, nor the subtleties of court.
1076922	I do, Your Honor.
1076923	I feel this would be an appropriate time to take a short break.
1076924	I got caught fencing some jewels. My testimony is part of the plea bargain.
1076925	I have always respected the great Britannian legal system. I have placed my trust in it.
1076926	I have received it.
1076927	I mean, please ask thyself that question, and consider this case most carefully.
1076928	I only wish to convey the horror this child must have endured in the darkness, while the screams of the dying echoed all around her.
1076929	I plead for my life, but, oh my friends, I plead more for Justice.
1076930	I remind the court that testimony given as part of a plea bargain is perfectly admissible.
1076931	I see. Still, we must arrange the representation of the defendant, or reconvene when Mr. Beauregard is in a position to fulfill his capacities.
1076932	I see. Who gave you that crown?
1076933	I take stolen stuff and pass it on, or sell it to others.
1076934	I thought she’d hid good, was sure of it, hoped so at least. But then I saw one of them snakes sniffing around the door.
1076935	I want to tell you that she remained hidden and safe in that cellar.
1076936	I want to tell you that the Ophidians withdrew and returned to their lairs, content with their mayhem.
1076937	I would like to put forward a motion of no confidence in my Defense, Your Honor.
1076938	I yield the witness to my friend, Mr. Beauregard.
1076939	I’m done with this man.
1076940	I’m sorry?
1076941	If a man slay a beast, even outside the Kingdom’s borders, can he not take whatever he finds?
1076942	If it pleases the court, my defender seems to be drunk, as well.
1076943	Indeed, Your Honor, quite prepared!
1076944	Indeed, Your Honor.
1076945	Indeed.
1076946	Indeed. So the Ophidians had no opposition?
1076947	Innocent.
1076948	Instead they left their nation defenseless, and now, in their haste to cover their cowardice, they lay the blame on me.
1076949	Instead, the terrified child sought shelter in the depths of a dark cellar, hidden, as best she could, in the impossibly tight space between a few water barrels.
1076950	Inu the Crone, kidnapped off the streets of Britain, held against her will, this man saved her!
1076951	Inu… the what? Who?
1076952	Irregular, but I can allow it.
1076953	Is that all, Mr. Beauregard?
1076954	Is that at issue? I did not…
1076955	Is the Defense prepared?
1076956	It cannot be argued that Ricardo stole the Scion’s Zenith, as we have written testimony that he has admitted it.
1076957	it is accorded, That if any other Case, supposed Treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any Justices,
1076958	It is my hope you will answer Justice this day with a resounding voice.
1076959	It was fast, that’s what it was.
1076960	It went in. It was in there for a long time, and then I heard a scream. It’d gotten pretty quiet by then.
1076961	Lacking any further witnesses, I call Mr. Casca to the stand.
1076962	Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I’d like to begin by telling you a story about a young girl named Liane.
1076963	Ladies and gentlemen, I am not a smart man, and definitely not a noble one.
1076964	Let the record show that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.
1076965	Liane suffered that instant of agony alone, as she watched her father fall before her eyes, yet in all the carnage managed to escape meeting her family’s fate.
1076966	Liane was no exception.
1076967	Like I said, he told me he got it from the snakes.
1076968	Lord Francesco was kind to point out that strange and curious addition to the Treason Act.
1076969	Lord Francesco, could you introduce yourself briefly?
1076970	Lord Francesco, please.
1076971	May the mercy of our True Sovereign be upon us.
1076972	Members of the jury shall remain seated, all else are free to go.
1076973	Met ‘em? We’re good buddies! Hey Ricardo!
1076974	Mmhm… and you saw that snake heading towards her?
1076975	Moving on. Mr. Casca?
1076976	Mr. Beauregard had not even arranged any witnesses to testify on my behalf.
1076977	MR. BEAUREGARD!
1076978	Mr. Beauregard, does this line of inquiry have a point?
1076979	Mr. Beauregard?
1076980	Mr. Casca, are the Ophidian lands under the control of the Britannian government?
1076981	Mr. Casca, of the charges levied against me, which have you failed to demonstrate?
1076982	Mr. Casca, thou mayest begin.
1076983	Mr. Casca, your next witness?
1076984	Mr. Casca?
1076985	Mr. Ricardo, dost thou feel that you canst more truly represent thyself than those who have been, or may be appointed in thine behalf?
1076986	Mr. Ricardo, I doubt you comprehend the ramifications of representing thyself.
1076987	Mr. Ricardo, you are hereby remanded to the State for execution.
1076988	Mr. Ricardo? Thou understandeth that ye are in no position to dictate the course of this affair?
1076989	My client is innocent!
1076990	My defender seems to be asleep.
1076991	My friends, I walk amongst you as a stranger to your culture, and to your ways.
1076992	My friends, there is no body and there is, no, crime.
1076993	My people, the Elves of Heartwood, were long separated from our brethren the Britannians.
1076994	Never met her in my life, Your Honor. Although…
1076995	No!
1076996	No! Instead, we found them building machines of horrible power deep within the earth.
1076997	No, today, Justice cannot yield to mercy, even as Compassion was never shown to all those who paid the price for Ricardo’s crimes.
1076998	No, Your Honor.
1076999	No, Your Honor. Motion to delay?
1077000	No, Your Honor. The Prosecution rests.
1077001	Nor the ones that destroyed the thousands of lives lost during the war.
1077002	Nothing further, Mr. Ricardo?
1077003	Now this young lady was kind, generous, altogether virtuous, and quite beloved of the townspeople.
1077004	Objection noted. Please proceed.
1077005	Objection! Hearsay!
1077006	Objection! Leading the witness!
1077007	Objection, Your Honor!
1077008	Oh no! We fought ‘em, we did. I had me trusty crossbow at me side.
1077009	Oh, well then, thank you.
1077010	Oh.
1077011	Oh? And why was that?
1077012	On the charge of High Treason, how does the jury find the defendant?
1077013	One moment it was quiet, the next the jungle was a full of ‘em. They were everywhere.
1077014	One moment Mr. Ricardo.
1077015	One, Compass or imagine the death of our lord the Sovereign
1077016	One, that Ricardo is the same Ricardo accused in the matter of this trial.
1077017	Order!
1077018	Our only wish is that the jury carefully hear all the evidence presented from this point forward.
1077019	Overruled. That was for clarification. The witness may answer.
1077020	Please answer.
1077021	Please read it.
1077022	Proceed, but tread carefully Mr. Ricardo.
1077023	Proceed.
1077024	Proceed.
1077025	Ricardo did not wield the bardiche that cut short Liane’s life.
1077026	Ricardo.
1077027	Right, then.
1077028	Second, that Ricardo committed, and did in fact admit to, the theft of the Scion’s Zenith.
1077029	She lived with her family in a sleepy little village, and lived a humble yet blissful life.
1077030	Sir, may I inquire as to your profession?
1077031	So noted.
1077032	So, it seemeth my friend Mr. Casca wisheth to establish a most sad tale of woe! Is that it, Hudson?
1077033	Some may be confused by the elegant words you heard Lord Francesco speak. Please don’t be.
1077034	Someone help me catch her!
1077035	Soon enough the guards were down, and the barriers around the town, they just weren’t working.
1077036	Soon we were all running for the shore – figured we could swim if we couldn’t get through the trees.
1077037	Stop! Stop I say!
1077038	Sure. I’m a fence.
1077039	Sustained!
1077040	Sustained.
1077041	Sustained. Mr. Beauregard, this man is not on trial. Change your line of questioning.
1077042	Tell me, then, did Ricardo not aid an old woman locked in a dungeon? Surely the Council is aware of this incident?
1077043	Thank you Hudson.
1077044	Thank you, I’m finished.
1077045	Thank you, Lord Francesco.
1077046	Thank you, sir.
1077047	Thank you, Your Honor.
1077048	Thank you.
1077049	Thank you.
1077050	Thank you. Is there any additional text concerning the definition of High Treason?
1077051	Thank you. Not bad for a thief, eh?
1077052	Thank you. Your Honor, I call my next witness to the stand.
1077053	That man is Ricardo, the so-called legendary thief.
1077054	That man, ladies and gentlemen, is seated before us.
1077055	That their sole, and greatest duty, be that the Truth come forward, and upon that foundation a fate be determined.
1077056	That they decide only upon the facts of this case.
1077057	That trust tells me that you must act in accordance with those laws. I have laid them plainly before you.
1077058	That was acceptable.
1077059	That’s right.
1077060	That’s… it?
1077061	That's immaterial - they're monsters.
1077062	The Act allows the Council to define new and specific instances of Treason.
1077063	The charge of Theft, at this point, may unduly influence the decision on the charge of Treason. Also, the charge of Conspiracy cannot be substantiated.
1077064	The clerk shall read the charges against the Defendant and report his pleas.
1077065	The conditions are not only met, but are exceeded.
1077066	The court finds the defendant guilty of High Treason.
1077067	The court finds the defendant innocent. Mr. Ricardo, you are free to go.
1077068	The court shall disregard, and the Defense will keep observations of the Court to themselves.
1077069	The crown thing? Sure. Broke it up for for the rares: gold, jewels, you know.
1077070	The Defendant will remain silent.
1077071	The Defendant, Ricardo, has pleaded Not Guilty to the following charges:
1077072	The Defense shall refute the claims of the Prosecution, and prove, or at least provide some reasonable shred of doubt, that Ricardo is innocent of the crimes attributed him.
1077073	The findings are:
1077074	The findings of the Investigating Magistrate are not a matter for debate. Continue.
1077075	The jury will disregard testimony concerning Inu the Crone - irrelevance.
1077076	The jury will now decide the facts of this case, and render a verdict of Guilty or Innocent for the charge of High Treason.
1077077	the Justices shall tarry without any going to Judgement of the Treason till the Cause be shewed and declared before the Sovereign and his Council,
1077078	The least I can be allowed is a chance to speak. Is this not fair?
1077079	The magic ones, you know, that protect cities. All of ‘em have ‘em.
1077080	The man you see sitting before thee is but a pitiful pawn in a game of chess.
1077081	The Ophidians and Terathans, you mean?
1077082	The Ophidians hunted down every man, woman, and child they could find in that city, and slaughtered them without mercy.
1077083	The People calls Hudson of Papua to the stand.
1077084	The People calls Nicholas to the stand
1077085	The Prosecution has failed to establish a link between the assault on the prison transport and any conspiracy on the part of the defendant.
1077086	The Prosecution has failed, you see, to actually prove a crime was committed.
1077087	The Prosecution has submitted its case to the court quite plainly.
1077088	The Prosecution hath concluded its opening statement.
1077089	The prosecution will show beyond any reasonable doubt that Ricardo’s theft of the Scion’s Zenith, an artifact of great importance to the Ophidians, was the direct cause of the war.
1077090	The Prosecution wishes to dismiss the charges of Theft and Conspiracy against the defendant.
1077091	The Prosecution wishes to submit the findings of Justice Edgar, juge d’instruction for this case, as People’s Exhibit the First.
1077092	The record does so show.
1077093	The record shows the findings as People’s Exhibit the First, and that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.
1077094	The Royal Council has determined that the acts Ricardo committed amount to High Treason.
1077095	Theft, namely of a foreign national treasure.
1077096	Then thou mayest proceed.
1077097	Then we will proceed to closing statements. Mr. Casca?
1077098	They do not, for they cannot.
1077099	They submit to you, as do I, as does Britannia herself, that Ricardo’s actions resulted in the needless deaths of thousands.
1077100	They were all over the docks, so I climbed a tree. Turned out they never found me up there.
1077101	Third, that a band of brigands did assault the transport carriage of Ricardo during his relocation to Yew.
1077102	This court is now in session. Please be seated.
1077103	This court is now open for the trial of criminal cases with and without jury.
1077104	This government has given itself the power to destroy any one of us by simply rewriting laws.
1077105	This has also been corroborated by a witness who had personal dealings with Ricardo.
1077106	This is the Court of Truth, Mr. Ricardo, dost thou so swear?
1077107	This is unfortunate, dost thou have any further witnesses?
1077108	Those snakes and spiders, ya ‘know, the monsters.
1077109	Thou mayest do so.
1077110	Three, Counterfeit the Royal Seal
1077111	Two, Levy war against the Sovereign in their Realm
1077112	Ah, Your Honor, I believe he is referring to Ricardo picking a lock for some mercenaries.
1077113	Very well, and again, good afternoon to you all.
1077114	Very well, let the record show that we hath concluded opening statements.
1077115	Very well, the charges of Theft and Conspiracy are hereby dropped.
1077116	Wait, is this the same woman who just willfully obstructed the court?
1077117	We define this instance as: "A willful act that results in great loss of life and property."
1077118	We have.
1077119	We judge his crime Treason most High.
1077120	We will further show that Ricardo, in doing so, invoked a war upon our shores like none seen in recent memory.
1077121	We will justify our call for the maximum penalty. This was a crime committed against all Britannia.
1077122	We will prove that Ricardo has committed High Treason, and we will demonstrate the law to which he will be held.
1077123	We’d had our fair share of trouble with the neighbors, but it’d been right calm since we’d become a part of the Kingdom proper.
1077124	Well I shall tell thee!
1077125	Well, well… well. So… you saw this scared, little, child of a girl run into this building all by herself?
1077126	What happened then?
1077127	What happened then?
1077128	What of this “blackrock” then? These strange magics and a rogue Ophidian queen?
1077129	What the government of Britannia wishes is for me to die, not to receive Justice.
1077130	What the jury must decide, though, is the validity of the Kingdom’s complaint.
1077131	What?
1077132	When you say barriers…
1077133	When you say neighbors, whom do you mean?
1077134	Where, I ask, was this vaunted Royal Council, that so easily passes judgment, in our time of need?
1077135	Where, I ask, were the mages to protect the barriers around our cities?
1077136	Where, I ask, were the soldiers when Papua was attacked?
1077137	whether it ought to be judged Treason or other Felony.
1077138	Which incident is that?
1077139	Wholeheartedly.
1077140	Why aren’t questions being asked?
1077141	Why art thou here, Nick?
1077142	Why, the door behind which Inu the Crone lay prisoner!
1077143	Would the jury foreman please stand.
1077144	Yes sir, I am. What’s left of it at least.
1077145	Yes, there is a specific clause extending the definition.
1077146	Yes, Your Honor!
1077147	Yes, Your Honor, just a moment more.
1077148	Yes, Your Honor, unless I were to represent myself before the court.
1077149	Yes, Your Honor.
1077150	Yes.
1077151	Yes?
1077152	Yet here I stand now, a citizen, yearning to do Justice by the laws and codes that have built our great society.
1077153	Yet, you see my friends, Liane died under an Ophidian's blade, true! But it was a Man who sealed her fate.
1077154	You can’t stop fate! They come! Oh they come!
1077155	You sat there, armed with a crossbow, and watched a girl get killed, doing nothing?!
1077156	You see, ladies and gentlemen, Liane lived in Papua, a territory of Britannia in the Lost Lands, and the first city to suffer under the sudden onslaught of the Ophidian army.
1077157	You there! Halt!
1077158	Your Hon…
1077159	Your Honor!
1077160	Your Honor! Calls for speculation on the part of the witness! On my part!
1077161	Your Honor! My client hath done none of these things!
1077162	YOUR HONOR! Please!
1077163	Your Honor! Speculation!
1077164	Your Honor, from the moment I entered the custody of the courts I've had no chance of defending myself.
1077165	Your Honor, I object to this, and…
1077166	Your Honor, I…
1077167	Your Honor, my witness seems to be absent.
1077168	Your Honor, surely Mr. Casca is an expert in his field and capable of evaluating his own case?
1077169	Your Honor, surely you will not…?
1077170	Your Honor, the Prosecution is most distressed by the behavior of the Defense.
1077171	Your Honor, the Prosecution would like to submit People’s Exhibit the Second at this time.
1077172	Your Honor?
1077173	Your Honor? Objection?
1077174	Your witness, sir.
1077175	Your…!
1077178	[WARNING: Spoilers ahead. Er, whoops.]
1077179	You are infused with the intense energy of this area.
1077180	You uncover a small piece of blackrock!
1077181	You unearth a large piece of blackrock!
1077182	Your backpack is too full, and it falls to the ground.
1077183	You carefully place it in your backpack.
1077184	You can't seem to find any blackrock...

1077203	That was most impressive, sir.
1077204	Oh, please don't be impressed.
1077205	Just take it in your heart to remember those who've gone on ahead of us.
1077206	Oh, ah, yes, yes of course.

1077286	After him! Someone!
1077287	Ah, er, no worries now folks! Let's try that again.
1077288	Ah, I didst not think of that, master
1077289	Ah, well, actions speak louder than words, no?
1077290	Argh!
1077291	Arghhhh!
1077292	Behind you...
1077293	Bet Wis Ex!
1077294	Boy! It's time!
1077295	But. There's nothing past here.
1077296	Call me Hawkwind.
1077297	Curious. The humans are at play again.
1077298	Did anyone feel that?
1077299	Did you double check the figures?
1077300	Did you seal the resonance chamber?
1077301	Did you set down all the runes?
1077302	Didst ye hear that, all? Go on about and explore - we needst some time to prepare a way back
1077303	Die.
1077304	Don't go! Oh! It's... *sighs*
1077305	Er, no, master
1077306	Everyone, back away!
1077307	Excuse me? Who art thou?
1077308	Excuse us, 'tis difficult to concentrate
1077309	Forgive me, dear, I must be off
1077310	Friends, I give you...
1077311	From yesterday.
1077312	Ghosts!
1077313	Good, now, let's tune this thing and get out of...
1077314	Good.
1077315	He dies in his own element.
1077316	Hmm, yes. Send everyone off for a bit, I need to think.
1077317	Hop to it then, boy!
1077318	How amusing.
1077319	Hrm, ah, erm...
1077320	Hurry up then!
1077321	I cannot die any more than you can!
1077322	I postulate that every single piece of blackrock in the world will be made known unto us!
1077323	I will then cast a simple spell of locating, thinking of blackrock...
1077324	Imagine it! Soon, we'll be able to gather all of the blackrock we want and...
1077325	Interference?
1077326	Ironic.
1077327	Is it really Moonglow?
1077328	Is this it, then?
1077329	It is with great pride that I stand before you today
1077330	It's... there's nothing there!
1077331	Kronos!
1077332	Kronos?
1077333	Ladies and gentlemen!
1077334	Let us go amongst them.
1077335	Mage! Get me out of here!
1077336	Master!
1077337	Master! Hold on!
1077338	Master, by the virtues, what is this?
1077339	Master?
1077340	Master...?
1077341	His body...
1077342	Melissa! Didst anyone see her?
1077343	Melissa?
1077344	No. No, I think they're... us.
1077345	Not to act upon the blackrock, but to use the blackrock to act upon something else!
1077346	Now hurry on! We'll talk later!
1077347	Now, now hold on a moment!
1077348	Of course, master
1077349	Oh! So this is how I look from the behind
1077350	Perish.
1077351	Remember! Come back tomorrow!
1077352	Right! Well... folks, we seem to be having some... minor difficulties
1077353	Runnnn!
1077354	Shall we wait?
1077355	So, darling, canst thou get us out of here?
1077356	Something's wrong
1077357	Soon, we'll be able to focus intense magical energy in a small confined space
1077358	Sorry, we're rather busy
1077359	Stay away! Back away I said!
1077360	Suffer.
1077361	Thank you all for being so patient
1077362	Thank you, my dear

Monsters in the dungeons guard the books, and only one of the books is the real Book of Truth. If you can find 50 of these books, we can inspect each one and hopefully one of them will be the real Book of Truth. We must recover the Book of Truth so we can stop the dark entities from destroying this reality. Find 50 of these books, and we will reward you with a virtuous prize.

1077443	The Book of Truth has been stolen! 'Tis said that the dark entities from beyond our world are behind this evil deed, and to keep us from finding it, they've made lots of copies. My twin sister and I have made a pledge to help return the book to safety, but I'm afraid that we wouldn't be very useful in the dungeons.

1077445	Thank you for responding to our call for help. As you know, dark entities from beyond our world have stolen the Book of Truth. To keep us from finding the book, they have created thousands of false books, which are carried by the denizens of dungeons Covetous, Deceit, Despise, Destard, Hythloth, Shame and Wrong. Return 25 of these copies to me, and I shall reward you with a sword unlike any other in the lands.
1077446	Please help us find the real Book of Truth! Awful dark entities from beyond our world have stolen it, made fake copies and spread them all over the dungeons. Bring me 10 of these books, and I'll give you a rare music box gear that has been in my family for generations. Won't you please help us find the real Book of Truth?

1077577	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Cast fireballs and lightning bolts against monsters there until you have raised your Magery skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings. You seek to unlock the secrets of the arcane art of Magery. The New Haven Mage Council has an assignment for you. Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven. We need your assistance in cleansing the town of this evil influence. Old Haven is located east of here. I suggest using your offensive Magery spells such as Fireball and Lightning Bolt against the Undead that inhabit there.<BR><BR>Make sure you have plenty of reagents before embarking on your journey. Reagents are required to cast Magery spells. You can purchase extra reagents at the nearby Reagent shop, or you can find reagents growing in the nearby wooded areas. You can see which reagents are required for each spell by looking in your spellbook.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077578	Very well, come back to me when you are ready to practice Magery. You have so much arcane potential. 'Tis a shame to see it go to waste. The New Haven Mage Council could really use your help.
1077579	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077580	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage. Return to Kaelynna in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077581	Well done! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this staff. Normally a mage must unequip weapons before spell casting. While wielding your new Ember Staff, however, you will be able to invoke your Magery spells.<BR><BR>Even if you do not currently possess skill in Bludgeoning, the Ember Staff will allow you to fight as if you do. However, your Magery skill will be temporarily reduced while doing so.<BR><BR>Finally, the Ember Staff occasionally smites a foe with a Fireball while wielding it in melee combat. I hope the Ember Staff serves you well.

1077598	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and meditate there until you have raised your Meditation skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well met! I can teach you how to 'Stop the World' around you and focus your inner energies on replenishing your mana. What is mana? Mana is the life force for everyone who practices arcane arts. When a practitioner of magic invokes a spell or scribes a scroll, it consumes mana. Having an abundant supply of mana is vital to excelling as a practitioner of the arcane. Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stoics. The Meditation skill allows stoics to increase the rate at which they regenerate mana.<BR><BR>A stoic needs to perform abilities or cast spells to deplete mana before he can meditate to replenish it. Meditation can occur passively or actively. Actively Meditation is more difficult to master but allows for the stoic to replenish mana at a significantly faster rate. Metal armor interferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating.<BR><BR>Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and actively meditate to replenish it.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Stoic and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077599	Seek me out if you ever wish to study the art of Meditation. Good journey.
1077600	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic (for Meditation). Return to Gustar in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077601	Splendid! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this hat. When worn, the Philosopher's Hat will protect you somewhat from physical attacks. The Philosopher's Hat also enhances the potency of your offensive spells, lowers the mana cost of your arcane spells and abilities, and passively increases your mana regeneration rate. Ah yes, I almost forgot. The Philosopher's Hat also grants one other special ability to its wearer. It allows a chance for the wearer to cast spells without using any reagents. I hope the Philosopher's Hat serves you well.

1077603	A Scholarly Task
1077604	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use Psychology on all creatures you see there. You can also cast Magery spells as well to raise Psychology. Do these activities until you have raised your Psychology skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hello. Truly knowing your opponent is essential for landing your offensive spells with precision. I can teach you how to enhance the effectiveness of your offensive spells, but first you must learn how to size up your opponents intellectually. I have a scholarly task for you. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use Psychology on all creatures you see there. You can also cast Magery spells as well to raise Psychology.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scholar and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077605	Return to me if you reconsider and wish to become an Apprentice Scholar.
1077606	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Scholar. Return to Mithneral in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077607	You have completed the task. Well done. On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this ring. When worn, the Ring of the Savant enhances your intellectual aptitude and increases your mana pool. Your spell casting abilities will take less time to invoke and recovering from such spell casting will be hastened. I hope the Ring of the Savant serves you well.

1077609	The Rudiments of Self Defense
1077610	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there until you have raised your Fist Fighting skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Listen up! If you want to learn the rudiments of self-defense, you need toughen up, and there's no better way to toughen up than engaging in combat. Head East out of town to Old Haven and battle the undead there in hand to hand combat. Afraid of dying, you say? Well, you should be! Being an adventurer isn't a bed of posies, or roses, or however that saying goes. If you do take a dirt nap, go to one of the nearby wandering healers and they'll get you back on your feet.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Brawler and I will reward you with a prize.
1077611	Ok, featherweight. Come back to me if you want learn the rudiments of self-defense.
1077612	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Brawler. Return to Dimethro in New Haven to receive your prize.
1077613	It's about time! Looks like you managed to make it through your self-defense training. As I promised, here's a little something for you. When worn, these Gloves of Safeguarding will increase your awareness and resistances to most everything expect poison. Oh yeah, they also increase your natural health regeneration as well. Pretty handy gloves, indeed.<BR><BR>Oh, if you are wondering if your meditating will be hindered while wearing these gloves, it won't be. Mages can wear cloth and leather items without needing to worry about that.<BR><BR>Now get out of here and make something of yourself!
1077614	Gloves of Safeguarding
1077615	Scribing Arcane Knowledge
1077616	While here at the New Haven Magery Library, use a scribe's pen and scribe and 3rd and 4th circle Magery scrolls that you have in your spellbook. Remember, you will need blank scrolls as well. Do this until you have raised your Inscription skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings and welcome to the New Haven Magery Library! You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed in a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription may transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls.<BR><BR>Before you inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. It may sound easy, but there is a bit more to it. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of Inscription is mana. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. When inscribing 3rd circle or lower spells this will not be much of a problem for these spells consume a small amount of mana. However, when you are inscribing higher circle spells, you may see your mana drain rapidly. When this happens, pause or meditate before continuing.<BR><BR>I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077617	I understand. When you are ready, feel free to return to me for Inscription training. Thanks for stopping by!
1077618	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Scribe. Return to Jillian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077619	Scribing is a very fulfilling pursuit. I am pleased to see you embark on this journey. You sling a pen well! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this spellbook. When equipped, the Hallowed Spellbook greatly enhances the potency of your offensive spells when used against Undead. Be mindful, though. While this book is equipped, when you invoke your powerful spells and abilities vs. Humanoids such as other humans, orcs, ettins, trolls, and the like, your offensive spells will diminish in effectiveness. I suggest unequipping the Hallowed Spellbook when battling Humanoids. I hope this spellbook serves you well.

1077622	Vortex Cube
1077623	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Battle spell casting monsters there until you have raised your Magic Resistance skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met! To become a true master of the arcane art of Magery, I suggest learning the complementary skill known as Magic Resistance. While the name of this skill may suggest that it helps with resisting most magic, this is not the case. This skill helps you lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time. It does not lessen damage from spells such as Energy Bolt or Flamestrike.<BR><BR>The Magery spells that can be resisted are Clumsy, Curse, Feeblemind, Mana Drain, Mana Vampire, Paralyze, Paralyze Field, Poison, Poison Field, and Weaken.<BR><BR>The Necromancy spells that can be resisted are Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Mind Rot, and Pain Spike.<BR><BR>At higher ranks, the Magic Resistance skill also benefits you by adding a bonus to your minimum elemental resists. This bonus is only applied after all other resist modifications - such as from equipment - has been calculated. It's also not cumulative. It compares the number of your minimum resists to the calculated value of your modifications and uses the higher of the two values.<BR><BR>As you can see, RMagic Resistance is a difficult skill to understand, and even more difficult to master. This is because in order to improve it, you will have to put yourself in harm's way - as in the path of one of the above spells.<BR><BR>Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven. We need your assistance in cleansing the town of this evil influence. Old Haven is located east of here. Battle the undead spell casters that inhabit there.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077624	The ability to resist powerful spells is a taxing experience. I understand your resistance in wanting to pursue it. If you wish to reconsider, feel free to return to me for Magic Resistance training. Good journey to you!
1077625	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage (for Magic Resistance). Return to Alefian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077626	You have successfully begun your journey in becoming a true master of Magery. On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this bracelet.

1077634	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Mage profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Kaelynna teaches Magery. I suggest seeking her out first. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle.<BR><BR>Gustar teaches Meditation. This skill allows someone to regenerate mana at an accelerated rate.<BR><BR>Mithneral teaches Psychology. This skill greatly enhances offensive Magery spells. Psychology also allows mages to 'size up' the mental capabilities of an opponent.<BR><BR>Dimethro teaches Fist Fighting. This skill enhances defense capabilities while in combat. Opponents will have a harder time landing blows against mages while they are spell casting.<BR><BR>Jillian teaches Inscription. This skill allows scribes to create scrolls that can be added to spellbooks. Inscription also slightly enhances a mage's offensive spells.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Magic Resistance which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Dimethro is located near the entrance to the New Haven dueling pits. The other instructors are located throughout the New Haven Mage School.<BR><BR>May your spells never fail you!

I would recommend the katana, as there's nothing better than three feet of steel to make anything think twice 'bout attackin' ya.<br><br>Tell ya what. Get me that katana. It's over there on the table. I need to look at it to be sure it's fit to skewer the unnaturals up ahead.
1077638	Well then, ya ain't gettin' through that gate until you bring me that katana.
1077639	That's it! A good soldier learns ta follow orders. Bring it ta me fer yer reward.
1077640	Here ya go. It looks plenty strong enough ta me.<br><br>Oh and best work on keeping yer eyes open. I slipped it back into yer bag when you wasn't lookin' Haha!
1077641	Try that there katana. The long, metal one with the sharp edge on it.

1077645	Good!<br><br>Do you see the glowing light?<br><br>Right click and hold over it to run in that direction.
1077646	Alright! Now you have your footing.<br><br>Many things you find in the world, you will be able to pick up and carry.<br><br>You have been given a backpack to carry all your belongings in.<br><br>Left click on the Backpack Icon in the lower right corner of your screen.
1077647	This is where you will carry items.<br><br>Up ahead are some crates. There are supplies in them you may need.<br><br>To open the crates, mouse over them until you see their item properties.<br><br>Double Left click on it to see what's inside.
1077648	To pick up an object, Left click and drag it into your backpack window.<br><br>There are other goodies in the crates and barrels, go ahead and grab some for yourself.
1077649	Excellent!<br><br>Now approach Hogarth the Keeper of Old Haven in the building to the East of you. He is the Keeper of Old Haven, and he has a task for you.<br><br>A glowing light toward the East marks his location.

1077651	Great! You are on your first quest.<br><br>It's a small one, but I'm sure you will be rewarded nonetheless.<br><br>Remember to pick up the Worn Katana and then talk to the Keeper to complete the quest.
1077652	You found the Worn Katana. You need to toggle it as a quest item.<br><br>Hold down the Shift key, Right click on yourself, and select 'Toggle Quest Item' from the context menu.

1077654	You will use this same method to put on weapons, armor, and clothing. The slot has to be clear of any other items. So if you are wearing a hat, and want to put on a helmet, you will have to take off the hat, first.<br><br>Left click the Next button to continue.
1077655	Well, well. Another youngling. You are here to prove your mettle. I think you have none. But there is some persistence in you. You may learn to master that weapon someday.<br><br>When you get some training under your belt and feel you have mastered your arts, come find me, so I can eliminate those who seek to keep this world from dark clutches.<br><br>Take this Rune. When you feel you have mastered your skills, come and find me. I will be waiting.
1077656	The Warrior's Path
1077657	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Warrior profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will probably want to talk to him first since knowing how to handle a weapon is the first step on the path to mastering the art of surviving on the path to becoming a warrior. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon doesn’t really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a warrior, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt
1077658	The Way of the Blade
1077659	You feel much more attuned to your blade. Your ability to hone your Swordsmanship skill is enhanced in this area.
1077660	You feel less attuned to your blade. Your Swordsmanship learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077661	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. While wielding your sword, battle monsters there until you have raised your Swordsmanship skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>*As you approach, you notice Jockles sizing you up with a skeptical look on his face*<br><br>I can see you want to learn how to handle a blade. It's a lot harder than it looks, and you're going to have to put in a lot of time and effort if you ever want to be half as good as I am.<br><br>I'll tell you what, kid, I'll help you get started, but you're going to have to do all the work if you want to learn something. East of here, outside of town, is Old Haven. It's been overrun with the nastiest sort of undead you've seen, which makes it the perfect place for you to turn that sloppy grin on your face into actual skill at handling a sword.<br><br>Make sure you have a sturdy Swordsmanship weapon in good repair before you leave. 'Tis no fun to travel all the way down there just to find out that you forgot your blade!<br><br>When you feel that you've cut down enough of those foul smelling things to learn to handle a blade without hurting yourself, come back to me. If I think you've improved enough, I'll give you something suited for a real warrior.
1077662	Ha! I had a feeling you were a lily-livered pansy. You might have potential, but if you're scared by a few smelly undead, maybe it's better that you stay away from sharp objects. After all, you wouldn't want to hurt yourself swinging a sword. If you change your mind, I might give you another chance...maybe.
1077663	*Jockles look you up and down*<br><br>Come on! You've got to work harder than that to get better. Now get out of here, go kill some more of those undead to the east in Old Haven, and don't come back till you've got some real skill.
1077664	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Swordsman. Return to Jockles in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you. Hopefully he'll be a little nicer this time!
1077665	Well, well, look at what we have here! You managed to do it after all. I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you came back in one piece, but since you did, I've got a little something for you.<br><br>This is fine blade that served me well in my younger days. Of course I've got much better swords at my disposal now, so I'll let you go ahead and use it under one condition. Take good care of it and treat it with the respect that a fine sword deserves.<br><br>You're one of the quickest learners I've seen, but you still have a ways to go. Keep at it, and you'll get there someday. Happy hunting, kid.
1077666	Jockles' Quicksword
1077667	The Art of War
1077668	You feel like practicing combat here would really help you learn to fight better. Your ability to raise your Tactics skill is enhanced in this area.
1077669	You feel less able to absorb the lessons of combat. Your Tactics learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077670	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there until you have raised your Tactics skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Knowing how to hold a weapon is only half of the battle. The other half is knowing how to use it against an opponent. It's one thing to kill a few bunnies now and then for fun, but a true warrior knows that the right moves to use against a lich will pretty much get your arse fried by a dragon.<br><br>I'll help teach you how to fight so that when you do come up against that dragon, maybe you won't have to walk out of there "OooOOooOOOooOO'ing" and looking for a healer.<br><br>There are some undead that need cleaning out in Old Haven towards the east. Why don't you head on over there and practice killing things?<br><br>When you feel like you've got the basics down, come back to me and I'll see if I can scrounge up an item to help you in your adventures later on.
1077671	That's too bad. I really thought you had it in you. Well, I'm sure those undead will still be there later, so if you change your mind, feel free to stop on by and I'll help you the best I can.
1077672	You're making some progress, that I can tell, but you're not quite good enough to last for very long out there by yourself. Head back to Old Haven, to the east, and kill some more undead.
1077673	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior. Return to Alden Armstrong in New Haven to claim your reward.
1077674	Hey, good job killing those undead! Hopefully someone will come along and clean up the mess. All that blood and guts tends to stink after a few days, and when the wind blows in from the east, it can raise a mighty stink!<br><br>Since you performed valiantly, please take these arms and use them well. I've seen a few too many harvests to be running around out there myself, so you might as well take it.<br><br>There is a lot left for you to learn, but I think you'll do fine. Remember to keep your elbows in and stick'em where it hurts the most!
1077675	Arms of Armstrong
1077676	Bruises, Bandages and Blood
1077677	You feel fresh and are eager to heal wounds. Your ability to improve your Healing skill is enhanced in this area.
1077678	You feel as if you've seen enough blood to last a lifetime. Your Healing learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077679	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Heal yourself and other players until you have raised your Healing skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Ah, welcome to my humble practice. I am Avicenna, New Haven's resident Healer. A lot of adventurers head out into the wild from here, so I keep rather busy when they come back bruised, bleeding, or worse.<br><br>I can teach you how to bandage a wound, sure, but it's not a job for the queasy! For some folks, the mere sight of blood is too much for them, but it's something you'll get used to over time. It is one thing to cut open a living thing, but it's quite another to sew it back up and save it from sure death. 'Tis noble work, healing.<br><br>Best way for you to practice fixing up wounds is to head east out to Old Haven and either practice binding up your own wounds, or practice on someone else. Surely they'll be grateful for the assistance.<br><br>Make sure to take enough bandages with you! You don't want to run out in the middle of a tough fight.
1077680	No? Are you sure? Well, when you feel that you're ready to practice your healing, come back to me. I'll be right here, fixing up adventurers and curing the occasional cold!
1077681	Hail! 'Tis good to see you again. Unfortunately, you're not quite ready to call yourself an Apprentice Healer quite yet. Head back out to Old Haven, due east from here, and bandage up some wounds. Yours or someone else's, it doesn't much matter.
1077682	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Healer. Return to Avicenna in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077683	Hello there, friend. I see you've returned in one piece, and you're an Apprentice Healer to boot! You should be proud of your accomplishment, as not everyone has "the touch" when it comes to healing.<br><br>I can't stand to see such good work go unrewarded, so I have something I'd like you to have. It's not much, but it'll help you heal just a little faster, and maybe keep you alive.<br><br>Good luck out there, friend, and don't forget to help your fellow adventurer whenever possible!
1077684	Healer's Touch
1077685	Know Thine Enemy
1077686	You feel very willing to learn more about the body. Your ability to hone your Anatomy skill is enhanced in this area.
1077687	You lose your ambition to learn about the body. Your Anatomy skill learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077688	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there, or heal yourself and other players, until you have raised your Anatomy skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met. You must be here to improve your knowledge of Anatomy. Well, you've come to the right place because I can teach you what you need to know. At least all you'll need to know for now. Haha!<br><br>Knowing about how living things work inside can be a very useful skill. Not only can you learn where to strike an opponent to hurt him the most, but you can use what you learn to heal wounds better as well. Just walking around town, you can even tell if someone is strong or weak or if they happen to be particularly dexterous or not.<BR><BR>If you're interested in learning more, I'd advise you to head out to Old Haven, just to the east, and jump into the fray. You'll learn best by engaging in combat while keeping you and your fellow adventurers healed, or you can even try sizing up your opponents.<br><br>While you're gone, I'll dig up something you may find useful.
1077689	It's your choice, but I wouldn't head out there without knowing what makes those things tick inside! If you change your mind, you can find me right here dissecting frogs, cats or even the occasional unlucky adventurer.
1077690	I'm surprised to see you back so soon. You've still got a ways to go if you want to really understand the science of Anatomy. Head out to Old Haven and practice combat and healing yourself or other adventurers.
1077691	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Healer (for Anatomy). Return to Andreas Vesalius in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077692	By the Virtues, you've done it! Congratulations mate! You still have quite a ways to go if you want to perfect your knowledge of Anatomy, but I know you'll get there someday. Just keep at it.<br><br>In the meantime, here's a piece of armor that you might find useful. It's not fancy, but it'll serve you well if you choose to wear it.<br><br>Happy adventuring, and remember to keep your cranium separate from your clavicle!
1077693	Tunic of Guarding
1077694	Escutcheon de Ariadne
1077695	Clasp of Concentration
1077696	The Inner Warrior
1077697	You feel much more attuned to yourself. Your ability to improve Focus skill is enhanced in this area.
1077698	You feel like you don't even know yourself anymore! Your Focus learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077699	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Expend stamina and mana until you have raised your Focus skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well, hello there. Don't you look like quite the adventurer!<br><br>You want to learn more about Focus, do you? I can teach you something about that, but first you should know that not everyone can be disciplined enough to excel at it. Focus is the ability to achieve inner balance in both body and spirit, so that you recover from physical and mental exertion faster than you otherwise would.<br><br>If you want to practice Focus, the best place to do that is east of here, in Old Haven, where you'll find an undead infestation. Exert yourself physically by engaging in combat and moving quickly. For testing your mental balance, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Go. Train hard, and you will find that your concentration will improve naturally. When you've improved your ability to focus yourself at an Apprentice level, come back to me and I shall give you something worthy of your new ability.
1077700	I'm disappointed. You have a lot of inner potential, and it would pain me greatly to see you waste that. Oh well. If you change your mind, I'll be right here.
1077701	Hello again. I see you've returned, but it seems that your Focus skill hasn't improved as much as it could have. Just head east, to Old Haven, and exert yourself physically and mentally as much as possible. To do this physically, engage in combat and move as quickly as you can. For exerting yourself mentally, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Return to me when you have gained enough Focus skill to be considered an Apprentice Stoic.
1077702	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic (for Focus). Return to Sarsmea Smythe in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you.
1077703	Look who it is! I knew you could do it if you just had the discipline to apply yourself. It feels good to recover from battle so quickly, doesn't it? Just wait until you become a Grandmaster, it's amazing!<br><br>Please take this gift, as you've more than earned it with your hard work. It will help you recover even faster during battle, and provides a bit of protection as well.<br><br>You have so much more potential, so don't stop trying to improve your Focus now! Safe travels!
1077704	Thou and Thine Shield
1077705	You feel as light as a butterfly, as if you could block incoming blows easily. Your ability to hone your Parrying skill is enhanced in this area.
1077706	Your inner butterfly is tired. You're not particularly able to block incoming blows well. Your Parrying learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077707	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters, or simply let them hit you, while holding a shield or weapon until you have raised your Parrying skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Oh, hello. You probably want me to teach you how to parry, don't you?<br><br>Very well.<br><br>First, you'll need a weapon or shield. Obviously shields work best of all, but you can parry with a 2-handed weapon. Or if you're feeling particularly brave, a 1-handed weapon will do in a pinch.<br><br>I'd advise you to go to Old Haven, which you'll find to the East, and practice blocking incoming blows from the undead there. You'll learn quickly if you have more than one opponent attack you at the same time to practice parrying lots of blows at once. That's the quickest way to master the art of parrying.<br><br>If you manage to improve your skill enough, I have a shield that you might find useful. Come back to me when you've trained to apprentice level.
1077708	It's your choice, obviously, but I'd highly suggest that you learn to parry before adventuring out into the world. Come talk to me again when you get tired of being beat on by your opponents.
1077709	You're doing well, but in my opinion, I don't think you really want to continue on without improving your parrying skill a bit more. Go to Old Haven, to the East, and practice blocking blows with a shield.
1077710	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior (for Parrying). Return to Tyl Ariadne in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077711	Well done! You're much better at parrying blows than you were when we first met. You should be proud of your newfound ability… and I bet your body is grateful to you as well.<br><br>*Tyl Ariadne laughs loudly at his own (mostly lame) joke*<br><br>Oh yes, I did promise you a shield if I thought you were worthy of having it, so here you go. My father made these shields for the guards who served my family faithfully for many years, and I just happen to have one that I can part with. You should find it useful as you explore the lands.<br><br>Good luck, and may the Virtues be your guide.

1077717	The Call to Knightship
1077718	Hail, brave knight! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Knight profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Aelorn teaches Knightship. I suggest talking to him first. Knightship is the main ability of the Knight. A Knight can evoke a number of abilities that can improve his prowess on the battlefield.<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Sarsmea Smythe teaches Focus. The ability to balance yourself physically and mentally can help a Knight stay fresh both in body and spirit.<BR><BR>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Knight in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent’s strength and dexterity.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Magic Resistance which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Alefian is located at the New Haven Mage School. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<BR><BR>May your enemies feel the wrath of the righteous.
1077719	Cleansing Old Haven
1077720	Your Knightship potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.
1077721	You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Knight. Your Knightship potential is not enhanced here.
1077722	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Consecrate your weapon, cast Divine Fury, and battle monsters there until you have raised your Knightship skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail, friend. The life of a Knight is a life of much sacrifice, humility, bravery, and righteousness. If you wish to pursue such a life, I have an assignment for you. Adventure east to Old Haven, consecrate your weapon, and lay to rest the undead that inhabit there.<br><br>Each ability a Knight wishes to invoke will require a certain amount of "tithing points" to use. A Knight can earn these tithing points by donating gold at a shrine or holy place. You may tithe at this shrine.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Knight.
1077723	Farewell to you my friend. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Knight.
1077724	There are still more undead to lay to rest. You still have more to learn. Return to me once you have done so.
1077725	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Knight. Return to Aelorn in New Haven to report your progress.
1077726	Well done, friend. While I know you understand Knightship is its own reward, I would like to reward you with something that will protect you in battle. It was passed down to me when I was a lad. Now, I am passing it on you. It is called the Bulwark Leggings. Thank you for your service.

1077730	The Art of Forging Metal
1077731	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Blacksmith profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>George Hephaestus teaches Blacksmithing. Obviously, knowing how to forge metal into weapons and armor is what defines a blacksmith. He can be found right next to me in this shop.<br><br>Amelia Youngstone teaches Tinkering. Tinkering complements the blacksmith skill as it allows you to craft your own blacksmithing tools, as well as other useful items. Amelia's workshop is Northwest of here in town.<br><br>Jacob Waltz teaches Mining. Without the knowledge of mining ore and smelting, a blacksmith will have to purchase ingots from the market. This greatly cuts into the profit making potential of Blacksmithing. You can find Jacob up in the hills to the South outside of town.<br><br>Kaelynna teaches Magery. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle. The sheer versatility of the Magery skill makes it highly useful to any blacksmith. Kaelynna resides North of here in the New Haven Mage School.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. Knowing how to handle a weapon is very important if you want to protect yourself from brigands and monsters. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not. Jockles can be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall which is East of here.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This skill complements Swordsmanship, as just knowing how to handle a weapon doesn't really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe. Alden can also be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall.<br><br>Good luck, and remember that a respected Blacksmith never tries to overcharge for services!
1077732	It’s Hammer Time!
1077733	By using George’s forge and anvil, he is able to give you advice as you create blacksmithing items. This helps you hone your Blacksmithing skill a bit faster than normal.
1077734	You’re not using George’s forge and anvil any longer, and he cannot give you advice. Your Blacksmithing learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077735	Create new daggers and maces using the forge and anvil in George's shop. Try making daggers up to 45 skill, the switch to making maces until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center><br>Hail, and welcome to my humble shop. I'm George Hephaestus, New Haven's blacksmith. I assume that you're here to ask me to train you to be an Apprentice Blacksmith. I certainly can do that, but you're going to have to supply your own ingots.<br><br>You can always buy them at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine your own. That way, any items you sell will be pure profit!<br><br>So, once you have a supply of ingots, use my forge and anvil here to create items. You'll also need a supply of the proper tools
1077736	You're not interested in learning to be a smith, eh? I thought for sure that's why you were here. Oh well, if you change your mind, you can always come back and talk to me.
1077737	You’re doing well, but you’re not quite there yet. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make daggers up until 45 skill, and then switch to maces. Also, don’t forget that using my forge and anvil will help you learn faster.
1077738	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Blacksmith. Return to George Hephaestus in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you.
1077739	I've been watching you get better and better as you've been smithing, and I have to say, you're a natural! It's a long road to being a Grandmaster Blacksmith, but I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it you'll get there someday. Let me give you one final piece of advice. If you're smithing just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.<br><br>Now that you're an Apprentice Blacksmith, I have something for you. While you were busy practicing, I was crafting this hammer for you. It's finely balanced, and has a bit of magic imbued within that will help you craft better items. However, that magic needs to restore itself over time, so you can only use it so many times per day. I hope you find it useful!
1077740	Hammer of Hephaestus
1077741	The Right Tool for the Job
1077742	By tinkering inside of Amelia’s workshop, she is able to give you advice. This helps you hone your Tinkering skill faster than normal.
1077743	Since you’ve left Amelia’s workshop, she cannot give you advice. Your Tinkering learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077744	Create new scissors and hammers while inside Amelia's workshop. Try making scissors up to 45 skill, the switch to making hammers until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center><br>Hello! I guess you're here to learn something about Tinkering, eh? You've come to the right place, as Tinkering is what I've dedicated my life to. <br><br>You'll need two things to get started: a supply of ingots and the right tools for the job. You can either buy ingots from the market, or go mine them yourself. As for tools, you can try making your own set of Tinker's Tools, or if you'd prefer to buy them, I have some for sale.<br><br>Working here in my shop will let me give you pointers as you go, so you'll be able to learn faster than anywhere else. Start off making scissors until you reach 45 tinkering skill, then switch to hammers until you've achieved 50. Once you've done that, come talk to me and I'll give you something for your hard work.
1077745	I’m disappointed that you aren’t interested in learning more about Tinkering. It’s really such a useful skill!<br><br>*Amelia smiles*<br><br>At least you know where to find me if you change your mind, since I rarely spend time outside of this shop.
1077746	Nice going! You're not quite at Apprentice Tinkering yet, though, so you better get back to work. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make scissors up until 45 skill, and then switch to hammers. Also, don't forget that working here in my shop will let me give you tips so you can learn faster.
1077747	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Tinker. Talk to Amelia Youngstone in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you.
1077748	You've done it! Look at our brand new Apprentice Tinker! You've still got quite a lot to learn if you want to be a Grandmaster Tinker, but I believe you can do it! Just keep in mind that if you're tinkering just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.  <br><br>Come here, my brand new Apprentice Tinker, I want to give you something special. I created this just for you, so I hope you like it. It's a set of Tinker's Tools that contains a bit of magic. These tools have more charges than any Tinker's Tools a Tinker can make. You can even use them to make a normal set of tools, so that way you won't ever find yourself stuck somewhere with no tools!

1077750	The Delucian’s Lost Mine
1077751	You can almost smell the ore in the rocks here! Your ability to improve your Mining skill is enhanced in this area.
1077752	So many rocks, so little ore… Your potential to increase your Mining skill is no longer enhanced.
1077753	Find Jacob's Lost Mine and mine iron ore there, using a pickaxe or shovel. Bring it back to Jacob's forge and smelt the ore into ingots, until you have raised your Mining skill to 50. You may find a packhorse useful for hauling the ore around. The animal trainer in New Haven has packhorses for sale.<br><center>-----</center><br>Howdy! Welcome to my camp. It's not much, I know, but it's all I'll be needin' up here. I don't need them fancy things those townspeople have down there in New Haven. Nope, not one bit. Just me, Bessie, my pick and a thick vein 'o valorite.<br><br>Anyhows, I'm guessin' that you're up here to ask me about minin', aren't ya? Well, don't be expectin' me to tell you where the valorite's at, cause I ain't gonna tell the King of Britannia, much less the likes of you. But I will show ya how to mine and smelt iron, cause there certainly is a 'nough of up in these hills.<br><br>*Jacob looks around, with a perplexed look on his face*<br><br>Problem is, I can't remember where my iron mine's at, so you'll have to find it yourself. Once you're there, have at it with a pickaxe or shovel, then haul it back to camp and I'll show ya how to smelt it. Ya look a bit wimpy, so you might wanna go buy yourself a packhorse in town from the animal trainer to help you haul around all that ore.<br><br>When you're an Apprentice Miner, talk to me and I'll give ya a little somethin' I've got layin' around here... somewhere.
1077754	Couldn’t find my iron mine, could ya? Well, neither can I!<br><br>*Jacob laughs*<br><br>Oh, ya don’t wanna find it? Well, allrighty then, ya might as well head on back down to town then and stop cluttering up my camp. Come back and talk to me if you’re interested in learnin’ ‘bout minin’.
1077755	Where ya been off a gallivantin’ all day, pilgrim? You ain’t seen no hard work yet! Get yer arse back out there to my mine and dig up some more iron. Don’t forget to take a pickaxe or shovel, and if you’re so inclined, a packhorse too.
1077756	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Miner. Return to Jacob Waltz in at his camp in the hills above New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077757	Dang gun it! If that don't beat all! Ya went and did it, didn’t ya? What we got ourselves here is a mighty fine brand spankin’ new Apprentice Miner!<br><br>I can see ya put some meat on them bones too while you were at it!<br><br>Here’s that little somethin’ I told ya I had for ya. It’s a pickaxe with some high falutin’ magic inside that’ll help you find the good stuff when you’re off minin’. It wears out fast, though, so you can only use it a few times a day.<br><br>Welp, I’ve got some smeltin’ to do, so off with ya. Good luck, pilgrim!

1077773	The Darkness
1077774	To greet you wholeheartedly. To feel thankful for your willingness to help.<br><br>To not be able to see? To think that if the shrines of Compassion, Justice and Sacrifice are involved that it is likely that Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is behind the darkness. To know that such powerful magic can be countered, but to believe that only by seeking the innate power of the opposite can it be done.<br><br>To recommend that you seek out more knowledge at Empath Abbey. To know that the monks there study how Love can overcome Hatred. To want you to take this book to the Keeper of the Flame at Empath Abbey. To suspect that she will understand.<br><br>To wish you good fortune against such a terrible foe.
1077775	To not know what to say. To think that perhaps you do not understand the seriousness of the situation. To hope you return soon to help.
1077776	To wish that you would hurry. To know that there is not much time.
1077777	You've failed to deliver the book to Empath Abbey. Return to Sin'Vraal to get another book.
1077778	Greetings, how may I help thee?<br><br>*Anne listens to your story*<br><br>Oh my! Astaroth you say? Well, Sin'Vraal may very well be right. Let me take a look at the book.
1077779	A Dark Flame
1077780	A Book of Ancient Gargish Prophicies
1077781	I'm sorry, I cannot help thee with that!
1077782	Just from looking at the first few pages, I think SinVraal was correct in sending you to me. I'll need some time to read more to be sure.<br><br>I'm feeling really thirsty though, so can you do me a favor? Fetch me a bottle of ale from the Innkeeper downstairs, and I'll study this while you're gone.
1077783	It's just downstairs! Do you want me to study this book or not?
1077784	You've failed to fetch Anne a bottle of ale! Return to Anne to see if she'll let you get her another bottle of ale.
1077785	Where's my ale? I'm really thirsty!
1077786	Finally! I was getting thirsty. Thank you.<br><br>Ok, so I've read some more of this book, and it does appear that Sin'Vraal's thinking was on track. As I'm sure you know, Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is compelled to oppose the Principle of Love and everything related to it. What you may not know is that Love and Hatred are entwined at a very basic level, and one cannot exist without the other to put it in perspective, nor can one become too influential without the other diminishing an equal amount.<br><br>From what I've read in this book, it's clear that by corrupting the shrines and extinguishing the Candle of Love, Astaroth is attempting to spread the influence of Hatred in the world. The more Hatred that exists, the less Love's presence is felt, and the more powerful Astaroth becomes! Obviously, we cannot let the balance swing too far in Astaroth's favor if we are to have any hope of thwarting his future plans.<br><br>The Candle of Love itself is kept in a cavern underneath the Abbey, far below where we're standing now. The entrance to the cavern can be found in the back room of the winery next door. However, the tunnel leading to the cavern is dark, and it seems that no normal light can pierce this unnatural darkness.<br><br>From what we’ve been able to discern, in order to enter this impenetrable curtain of darkness that now enshrouds the cavern, many brave adventurers will need to purify the light from a regular candle and then touch the purified flame to the Candle of Love. However, it all starts with one person... you.<br><br>Quickly, go to each of the three shrines and help cleanse them. Then meditate on each virtue, and the way forward will be shown to you. Only through doing this might you help oppose Astaroth's growing power.

1077875	You feel as if the shrine preferred that you do something else.
1077876	A Compassionate Task
1077877	As you meditate on the virtue of Compassion, you start to feel utter despise towards the human race. The feeling burns intensely in your heart, filling you with blind rage and a compulsion to maim and torture any human that dare enter your home.<br><br>As the feeling begins to fade, you see a vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal, and you somehow know that your path lies in that direction.
1077878	You suddenly feel quite ashamed of yourself.
1077879	You've strayed too far from the path of Compassion. Return to the Shrine of Compassion and meditate some more.
1077880	The vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal returns to your mind.
1077881	You place the blackened heart on the Shrine of Compassion and begin to meditate. Sadness overcomes you as you think about the fate of the ogre. Astaroth's influence in the ogre's life corrupted his heart to the extent that he was so consumed by despise of the human race that his capability to feel content with his life, much less to find true happiness, was completely taken away from him.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the ogre's corrupted heart has been purified by Compassion. You pick up the Heart of Compassion, as you have a feeling that you'll need it later if you hope to do your part in battling Astaroth's plan.
1077882	A Heart Blackened by Despise
1077883	You recognize the crystal ball as the one from your vision.
1077884	As you peer into the crystal ball, an image begins to form.
1077885	You see a very young ogre hiding at the back of his cave.
1077886	The ogre is watching a horrifying scene unfold before him.
1077887	A party of rage driven humans is torturing his family.
1077888	They are taking great pleasure in killing the ogre's family...
1077889	...as slowly and gruesomely as possible.
1077890	Tears silently stream down the young ogre's face.
1077891	You somehow hear him vow in his heart to grow up...
1077892	...and become the biggest and strongest ogre of them all...
1077893	...so that he might spend the rest of his days...
1077894	...seeking revenge against all of humanity.
1077895	As the image dissolves, you are shown a large heart...
1077896	...blackened, twisted and utterly consumed by...
1077897	...despise. You tremble at the horrible image before you.
1077898	The image finally fades, but not before you catch a glimpse...
1077899	...of Astaroth laughing, all too pleased with his handiwork.

1077921	For Great Justice!
1077922	As you meditate on the virtue of Justice, you find yourself envisioning a dusty skeleton, shackled to a wall. As you ponder the skeleton's existence, a feeling a great injustice washes over you suddenly.<br><br>As you step back from the shrine and open your eyes, the feeling subsides, leaving you with the strong desire to right this great wrong, whatever it may be.
1077923	Once again, the image of a skeleton shackled to a wall leaps to the forefront of your mind.
1077924	You place the rusty pen on the shrine and begin to meditate.<br><br>The injustice done to both Nina and Thomas stirs a feeling of great sadness inside of you. Though the record has finally been set straight after all these years, you can't help but to think that after all the executioner had done he deserved a far worse punishment than death.<br><br>You vow to meditate more on the Virtue of Justice in your future travels so that you might better understand how to temper your feelings with Love.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the pen has been transformed by Justice! Stepping up to the shrine, you take the Pen of Justice, as your intuition tells you that you'll need it eventually on your quest to thwart Astaroth.
1077925	That skeleton you’re poking at has a history, you know. ‘Tis all that is left of a boy that went by the name of Thomas. He was convicted for murder! A great injustice the whole farce turned out to be. I wrote his true story down in a journal, but the executioner found it. Even though I only had a few years left to serve, he had me executed on the spot.<br><br>I bet if you found my journal, you could clear Thomas’ name! Unfortunately, I don’t know where the executioner kept his things. Perhaps deeper in this prison?
1077926	Well, it's certainly up to you, but it would be nice for Thomas' name to be cleared after all this time...
1077927	You've failed to deliver the journal to someone who can clear Thomas' name! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost.
1077928	Why are you standing around here talking to a ghost? Get moving!
1077929	What's this? Why, yes, I do remember this case. It was quite a few years ago, but something seemed fishy about it back then and I've thought about the boy and his betrothed off and on since then.<br><br>*Andy reads the journal entry*<br><br>By the Virtues! I knew Thomas was innocent! Thank you so much for bringing this to me, I will make sure that the official record is changed as soon as possible. It won't undo the injustice done to Thomas, but it's the least we can do. Though, perhaps there is something more to be done...
1077930	OooooOOOOoooOOOooO... oh, wait, you can actually hear me.
1077931	OOoooOOOOOooOOOooOOOOOooO
1077932	This skeleton is awfully dusty!
1077933	Thomas' Story
1077934	I'm pretty sure that the journal can be found deeper inside the dungeon.
1077935	You've found the journal! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost with it.
1077936	Is that it? Hold it up here so I can read it and make sure it's my journal.
1077937	A Journal Delivery
1077938	'Tis my journal! It's strange to see it after all these years.<br><br>All that's left to do is to take it to someone that can change the official record. Perhaps someone at a court?<br><br>Maybe I can finally rest in peace!
1077939	Prisoner's Journal
1077940	Clearing Thomas' name!
1077941	Heart of Compassion
1077942	As you meditate on the virtue of Sacrifice, you envision a dark, watery cavern. As your mind wanders through the cave, you realize that there is treasure piled high against the wall. As you focus on the piles of gold and gems, a feeling of unbridled covetous washes over you with such force that your mind recoils away from the treasure.<br><br>It is at that moment that you realize you are being watched, as you spot a dark form moving amongst the shadows
1077943	A True Sacrifice
1077944	The feeling of covetous washes over you once again, compelling you to seek out its source.

1077962	The executioner still roams free in Dungeon Wrong after all these years. Go there, slay him, then return to me. By then, I will have found the pen that he used to sign the writ of execution for Thomas. Be careful, for he surrounds himself with many terrible creatures!
1077963	A Rusty Pen
1077964	Oh, I am very disappointed. How can you come this far to deny the Executioner the Justice that he so deserves?
1077965	You'll find the Executioner in Dungeon Wrong. Hurry!
1077966	You have slain the Executioner! Return to Andrew as soon as you can.
1077967	Well done! I hope that the Executioner didn't give you too much trouble.<br><br>As promised, here is the pen he used to sign writs of death.

1077976	*Anne blinks*<br><br>How can you possibly say no? Don't you know how important it is to defeat Astaroth?
1077977	I need the Heart of Compassion, the Quill of Justice and the Tear of Sacrifice plus a regular candle.
1077978	Talk to Anne to have her purify your candle!
1077979	Here, take this purified candle.<br><br>You have but one task remaining...
1077980	As you finish walking the path shown to you, you will be given sigils for each of the three virtues.<br><br>Bring me the Heart of Compassion, the Quill of Justice and the Tear of Sacrifice, along with a regular candle. In return, I will provide you with what you need to enter the cavern below.
1077981	Only one last task remains for you to help oppose Astaroth's growing power. Take the purified candle I just gave you, enter the Candle of Love Cavern below us, and touch your flame to the Candle of Love.<br><br>This isn't quite as simple as it sounds, as you'll need to do two things. First, remember to hold the purified candle in your hand to cross the area of darkness. Once you've done that, you will encounter a puzzle to solve that helps to protect the Candle of Love. Solve this puzzle, and touch your flame to the candle quickly, as you won't have much time once you've crossed the lava.<br><br>Before you go, I wish to thank you for all that you have done. Hurry now, for Astaroth will not wait.
1077982	The Candle of Love
1077983	You simply cannot walk away now! Please, I beg of thee, do not!
1077984	You've failed to bring the Purified Candle to the Candle of Love. Return to Anne, the Keeper of the Flame, to obtain another.
1077985	There is not much time left, please hurry!
1077986	As you touch your Purified Candle to the Candle of Love, you feel Astaroth's hold on this cavern diminish slightly. You've done your part to uphold the Principle of Love, now it up to your fellow Britannians to do theirs.
1077987	You stare into the Candle of Love.
1077988	The Candle of Love quickly absorbs your flame.
1077989	The Candle of Love absorbs your flame and you feel content with yourself.
1077990	The Candle of Love absorbs your flame and glows slightly, leaving you with a sense of wellbeing.
1077991	The Candle of Love sparks to life for a moment as it absorbs your flame, making you feel very hopeful for the future.
1077992	The Candle of Love roars to life, dispelling the darkness surrounding you. You are suddenly overcome with joy and begin to cry.
1077993	The darkness is impenetrable! Entering the cavern will not be easy...
1077994	It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
1077995	As Sudiva turns and stares at you, you wisely decide not to get any closer.
1077996	Sudiva looks at you as if she is waiting for you to do something.
1077997	Sudiva is no longer paying attention to you.
1077998	You may not sacrifice stats while under the influence of stat altering effects.
1077999	As you make your sacrifice, Sudiva sheds a tear. You pick it up and place it into your backpack.
1078000	Meditate again to sacrifice 30 of your highest stat. WARNING!
1078001	You have sacrificed enough already.
1078002	Your backpack is full, so the tear drops to the ground!

1078005	The Code of Bushido
1078006	Greetings! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Samurai profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>Hamato teaches Bushido. I suggest talking to him first. Bushido is the way of life for a Samurai. A Samurai can honorably execute his enemies or even evade powerful attacks such as dragon's breath or lightning bolts.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship.

I see you wish to learn the Way of the Samurai. Wielding a blade is easy. Anyone can grasp a sword's hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman. Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here.<br><br>Adventure East to Old Haven. Use the Confidence defensive stance and attempt to honorably execute the undead that inhabit there. You will need a book of Bushido to perform these abilities. If you do not possess a book of Bushido, you can purchase one from me. <br><br>If you fail to honorably execute the undead, your defenses will be greatly weakened: Resistances will suffer and Magic Resistance will suffer. A successful parry instantly ends the weakness. If you succeed, however, you will be infused with strength and healing. Your swing speed will also be boosted for a short duration. With practice, you will learn how to master your Bushido abilities.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you have become an Apprentice Samurai.
1078011	Good journey to you. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Samurai.
1078012	You are not ready to become an Apprentice Samurai. There are still more undead to lay to rest. Return to me once you have done so.

Upon a successful strike in combat, there is a chance this mighty weapon will replenish your stamina equal to the damage of your attack. I hope "The Dragon's Tail" serves you well.

Imagine yourself in a distant grove of trees. You raise your bow, take slow, careful aim, and with the twitch of a finger, you impale your prey with a deadly arrow. You look like you would make an excellent archer, but you will need practice. There is no better way to practice Marksmanship than when your life is on the line.<br><br>I have a challenge for you. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. While wielding your bow or crossbow, battle the undead that reside there.<br><br>Make sure you bring a healthy supply of arrows (or bolts if you prefer a crossbow). If you wish to purchase a bow, crossbow, arrows, or bolts, you can purchase them from me or the Archery shop in town. You can also make your own arrows with the Bowcrafting skill. You will need bowcrafter's tools, wood to turn into shafts, and feathers to make arrows or bolts.<br><br>Come back to me after you have achieved the rank of Apprentice Archer, and I will reward you with a fine Marksmanship weapon.
1078206	I understand that Marksmanship may not be for you. Feel free to visit me in the future if you change your mind.
1078207	You're doing great as an Archer! However, you need more practice. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Come back to me after you have achieved the rank of Apprentice Archer.
1078208	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Archer. Return to Robyn in New Haven to claim your reward.
1078209	Congratulations! I want to reward you for your accomplishment. Take this composite bow. It is called "Heartseeker". With it, you will shoot with swiftness, precision, and power. I hope "Heartseeker" serves you well.

1078212	There is no theory of evolution. Just a list of creatures I allow to live.
1078213	I don't sleep. I wait.
1078214	I can lead a horse to water and make it drink.
1078215	You feel you can track creatures here with ease. Your Tracking skill is enhanced in this area.
1078216	You feel it is more difficult to track creatures here. Your Tracking skill is no longer enhanced.
1078217	Track animals, monsters, and people on Haven Island until you have raised your Tracking skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hello friend. I am Walker, Grandmaster Ranger. An adventurer needs to keep alive in the wilderness. Being able to track those around you is essential to surviving in dangerous places. Certain Ninja abilities are more potent when the Ninja possesses Tracking knowledge. If you want to be a Ninja, or if you simply want to get a leg up on the creatures that habit these parts, I advise you learn how to track them.<br><br>You can track any animals, monsters, or people on Haven Island. Clear your mind, focus, and note any tracks in the ground or sounds in the air that can help you find your mark. You can do it, friend. I have faith in you.<br><br>Come back to me once you have achieved the rank of Apprentice Ranger (for Tracking), and I will give you something that may help you in your travels. Take care, friend.
1078218	Farewell, friend. Be careful out here. If you change your mind and want to learn Tracking, come back and talk to me.
1078219	So far so good, kid. You are still alive, and you are getting the hang of Tracking. There are many more animals, monsters, and people to track. Come back to me once you have tracked them.
1078220	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Ranger (for Tracking). Return to Walker in New Haven to claim your reward.
1078221	I knew you could do it! You have become a fine Ranger. Just keep practicing, and one day you will become a Grandmaster Ranger. Just like me.<br><br>I have a little something for you that will hopefully aid you in your journeys. These leggings offer some resistances that will hopefully protect you from harm. I hope these serve you well. Farewell, friend.

1078224	You’ll notice a little marker on the map. That’s a waypoint.<br><br>This waypoint shows you where a gate is. Follow the alley towards the marker, and head through the gate.<br><br>To open the gate, or any other door for that matter, just Double Left Click on it and it will open.
1078225	This is the town of old Haven, or what remains of it.<br><br>The former residents have been reanimated from the dead.<br><br>Your first challenge is to return just one of these skeletons to the grave.<br><br>Before you go running off, the first thing you need to do is set yourself in War Mode.<br><br>Click on the War/Peace button on the bar at the bottom left of your screen.
1078226	Great, now you are in an aggressive stance, perfect for fighting. <br><br>That’s hot.<br><br>Now remember to toggle back into Peace mode before you try to interact with friendly townsfolk.<br><br>They don’t usually take kindly to being attacked.<br><br>Now, select a target by left clicking on a skeleton.
1078227	Looks like you found a suitable target, Let’s slay the wretched beast.<br><br>Double left click on it, and move within reach.<br><br>Once you begin attacking, you will continue to do so until the creature is dead.
1078228	You destroyed one! <br><br>Nice work! <br><br>Now you can check it to see if it was carrying anything of value.<br><br>To do this, double left click on the corpse.
1078230	Well Done. <br><br>Now when you are hurt, or have taken any damage, it’s a good idea to heal up before going into battle again. <br><br>You have a Potion of Healing, which you found on the corpse, in your inventory.<br><br>To use the potion: Double Left Click on it in your inventory and you will drink it.
1078231	Not used.
1078232	Don’t use that scroll yet, you will need it against your next opponent.<br><br>Let’s head to the next waypoint on your map.

1078246	Alright, looks like you're ready to go.<br><br>Before you can start your adventures, you'll have to complete a few challenges.<br><br>Open your map at the bottom of the screen.
1078247	You'll notice a little marker on the map. That's a waypoint. This waypoint shows you where a gate is.<br><br>Follow the alley towards the marker, and head through the gate.<br><br>Once you arrive at the gate, Double Left click on it.
1078248	This is the town of Old Haven, or what remains of it. The former residents have been reanimated from the dead.<br><br>Your first challenge is to return just one of these skeletons to the grave.<br><br>Left click on the War/Peace button on the bar at the bottom left of your screen.

1078250	Looks like you found a suitable target.<br><br>Let's slay the wretched beast.<br><br>Double left click on the skeleton, and move within reach.<br><br>Once you begin attacking, you will continue to do so until the creature is dead.
1078251	You destroyed the skeleton! Nice work!<br><br>Now you can check it to see if it was carrying anything of value.<br><br>Double Left click on its corpse.
1078252	This is what the poor thing was carrying, remnants of its life long past. It's sad, really.<br><br>Anyway, drag all of these items to your inventory. You can right click on each item to loot as well.
1078253	Well done! When you have taken any damage, it's a good idea to heal up before going into battle again.<br><br>You have a Potion of Healing in your inventory. To drink the potion, Double Left click on it and you will drink it.<br><br>Even if you are not injured, try and drink the potion now.
1078254	Very good!<br><br>You should have a scroll of Magic Arrow in your backpack.<br><br>Scrolls, and other items, like the healing potion or bandages, can be put into your hotbar on the bottom left of your screen. <br><br>Drag the scroll of Magic Arrow from your inventory to an open slot on the hotbar.
1078255	Don't use that scroll yet. You will need it against your next opponent.<br><br>Let's head to the next waypoint on your map. Head Northwest, then North, and follow path to the East.<br><br>I'm waiting for you to approach the next gate.
1078256	Alright, the zombies beyond this gate are tough, but you have proven to be pretty good with a weapon thus far.<br><br>Head through the gate and take one of those zombies out.<br><br>When you have a zombie targeted, Left click on the Magic Arrow scroll icon in the hotbar to cast the spell.
1078257	Oh No! They got you.<br><br>Death in the world of Sosaria is not a trivial thing, but neither is it the end of your adventures.<br><br>You now exist in a ghostly state, and cannot interact with the world of the living.<br><br>The location of the nearest Healer appears on your map. Go to the location marked Resurrection on your map.
1078258	Good! You are back among the living.<br><br>Once you are resurrected you will have only 15 minutes to return to your body and collect your equipment from your corpse. Your corpse location is now marked on the map.<br><br>Double Left click on your corpse to retrieve your items.
1078259	Good job! You have retrieved your items. Take a look in your backpack and re-equip your weapon. You will also find a small gift from me.<br><br>The Token of Passage will allow you to get through a gate protected by an energy field. I have marked the gate on your map.<br><br>Head to the gate and pass through the energy field.
1078260	Uh oh. It's the Dark Knight. I don't see a way to slip past him.<br><br>So, it looks like you're going to have to talk to him.<br><br>Double Left click on the Dark Knight to speak with him, and let's hope he's in a good mood.
1078261	This gate will lead you out of here, and on the road to New Haven. It's a town of learning, a place where you will get trained and learn how to advance in all of the skills vital to your prosperity in the world of Sosaria.<br><br>Follow the path to the West.
1078262	Well, this is where we must part ways. There are more newcomers for me to assist, and I must return to the docks to help them.<br><br>On the map, I have marked the location of the person who will guide you through your continued training.<br><br>Farewell, friend.

1078563	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Good day, friend. I am Amser, leader of New Haven.<BR>As you can see, many things have changed in this city. Much of the island has sunken beneath the waves, and the old city lies ruined to the southeast. The refugees have told us of the great destruction that engulfed their homes, and all we can do is offer them shelter.<BR>You may notice that our village lacks the look of one rebuilt from the ruins. It is true - we, and our very city, are not from this time. The same forces that destroyed the island seem to have altered our own fates as well.<BR>We have been advised to not speak much of these things, at great peril, for we must preserve the past to ensure our future.<BR>Now then, please, our city is at your disposal. If you seek friends from the old city, you might wish to visit the inns or the infirmary. May the Virtues guide your path.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

1079712	Imbuing
1079713	Throwing
1079714	Mysticism consists of 16 spells and eight circles that signify their power and the magic ability required to cast them. These eight concentric circles correspond to vortices within the ether, all spinning one within another as they expand through the universe. The more powerful a spell you wish to cast, the deeper into the inner circles of ether you must penetrate. The deeper you go, the more mana (magical energy) each spell requires you to expend. Spells of the Eighth circle require great measures of both skill and mana, while spells of the First circle are much easier and require less energy.
1079715	The Imbuing skill allows player characters to imbue items with magical properties. The amount of skill determines how much magical power an artificer can imbue in an item.<BR><BR>The Imbuing skill allows player characters to magically unravel items into special ingredients. Artificers use these ingredients when imbuing items with magical power. Magically unraveling items always destroys the item in the process.
1079716	Throwing is a ranged combat skill. Thrown weapons return to you and do not require ammunition. If you have a throwing weapon equipped, you can attack a player, animal, NPC or monster as you normally would. You can attack your target so long as you have direct line of sight to them.

1094877	Oh Magincia, how strong you were.  Once the jewel of Sosaria...  Now I need the help of others to rebuild and the souls here need respite.  If you can speak to the Restless Souls, you may be able to help them move onward.  Bring me three of the Threads of Life that they should leave behind, and I will give you something to remember what we had forgotten.
1094878	If you can find a restless spirit and use Spiritualism, that may give you the ability to talk to them.
1094879	Ah, thank you!  With this we can begin to bring life back to this land.  Take this - may it be a reminder to you that life is precious.
1094880	The Forsaken Souls have become listless, desperate to find a way home.  You will need to use magic to convince them that they need to go on.  Please bring me five Threads of Thought that they leave behind.  While I do not have much, I can give what I have in return for your help.
1094881	A Necromancer with Exorcism should be able to send the forsaken souls to the beyond.
1094882	Ah!  With this we can hopefully undo the actions that have destroyed our precious city.  Please take this as a reminder of the consequences of action without thought.
1094883	I wish to undo the horrors that have beset Magincia but I need help.   There are some souls whose burden is so great that they have become corrupted and bound by the Threads of Fate.  Go to Magincia and cut the Corrupted Souls free by any means necessary, and gather the threads that they leave behind.
1094884	Fight the corrupted souls with sword and spell, and gather the Threads of Fate they leave behind!
1094885	Thank you so very much.  All we can offer is the rubble that was left behind in the wake of Magicinia’s destruction.  Cherish life and be thoughtful in your actions, lest you become humbled by the threads of fate that you weave upon yourself.

1094951	Search the Underworld for the lost adventurers.  Either bring word of their progress or evidence of their fate to Elder Dugan for your reward.<br><center>-----</center><br>Well met, traveler.  I am Elder Dugan, leader of the Society of Ariel Haven.  We are a society of prospectors who who have obtained writs of commission from Baron Almric to colonize this mountain.<br><br>After this mysterious mountain appeared complete with its own door... we sent in scouts and discovered that it is an ancient city, abandoned and overrun with wild creatures.  Thus, with the blessing of our Baron, we have come to claim and settle this new area and it will be called Ariel Haven.<br><br>We have been sending out adventuring parties to slowly push back the wild beasts and thus far we have managed to secure this hall.  Yesterday we sent a party in further to find our next area to claim and they have not returned... I am becoming concerned.<br><br>In your travels in this mountain would you look for my people?  If they are well, please bring me word, if misfortune has befallen them, please bring me evidence of their fate.
1094952	Very well, fare thee well traveler.  I would not press our problems upon you if you are not willing.  I pray that my people are simply trying to secure some treasure they found.
1094953	Greetings, have you any news of my people?  I am encouraged to see you well!
1094954	You observe the remains of four humans here.  As you observe the tragic scene, you are reminded that you promised to bring evidence to Elder Dugan of their fate.
1094955	You carefully search the body for anything that might identify who they were in life.  The skin of the body ripples as if something is crawling under the skin!  Look out!
1094956	Oh, this is indeed sad news.  It seems my worst fears have been realized!  These writs were given to Evan and Kevin Brightwhistle, Sergio Taylor, and Sarah Bootwell.  Based on your description of the ghastly scene, they have met a most untimely end!  This is a great setback to our society as they were each great friends to me and an asset to the society.<br><br>'Tis strange that there were only four bodies.... There was a fifth member of the party, Neville Brightwhistle, but he was the youngest and least experienced of the party so if his elder brothers are lost, surely young Neville met a similar fate. ‘Tis a tragedy, surely.<br><br>Please take this torch with my thanks.  It may not seem like much, but it is magic and will never burn out.  You will find that rotworms fear fire so it will protect you from them as you venture further into these cursed halls.<br><br>Tread carefully traveller, each member of the party had one of these so I suspect that the rotworms are not what ended their lives.

1094958	Thieves Be Afoot!
1094959	Keep an eye pealed, traveler, thieves be afoot!
1094960	Travel into the Underworld and search for the stolen barrels of barley.  Return them to Quartermaster Flint for your reward.<br><center>-----</center><br>Hail Traveler.  Trying to find the fabled Stygian Abyss are ye?  I say good luck, an' be weary for I believe there to be a den o' thieves hidden in them halls!  Aye, just last night I lost four barrels o' Barley.  I know they be sayin' that none but critters live in them halls, but I've looked every place I dare and seen no sign o' me barrels.<br><br>Hope them lazy Society folk got a good nap last night, cause they wan have any o' me fine Barley based products unless we get those barrels back!  I canne believe none of them loafers who was guarding the door saw nothin!  Oy, it makes me so mad, I must not think of it and control me temper... It's a frickin' barrel of Barley!  How could they miss seeing it???<br><br>Sorry... I don' mean ta be takin' it out on ye.  Tell you what friend.  You find those barrels and I will pay you for bringin' them back.  There be some nasty stuff in thar, so if'n ye bring back all four, I have somethin' special I will share with ye!
1094961	Fine then, be on yar way but be warned!  Ol' Flint makes the best refreshin' barley products in tha known world!  That barley will not profit ye if'n ol' Flint ha' not prepared it proper!
1094962	What?  Back so soon and narry a barrel in sight?  Be ye advised that ye are not the only traveler ol' Flint has a lookin fer his barrels!  If'n ye are gonna profit of me potions, ye best be about it!
1094963	The smug smell of Barley fills this chamber.
1094964	This barrel fits the description Flint gave you.  Boy is it heavy!
1094965	Ah, thar she is!  That's me barrel all right, I knew someone had taken it in thar!  Goblins you say? Oy, they be a nasty bit o' business, ain't they?  Well, a deal's a deal, here is yar potion as promised!
1094966	It's good to have ol' Flint's barrels back where they belong.  For this, ye are in for a special treat, some of ol' Flint's special brew!  This brew is so pungent that even after ye sober up people around ye will start feelin' tipsy!  It has a special bottle to keep it contained... err... I mean fresh, so don't lose it!

1094970	Travel into the Underworld and find the Flint's stolen log book.  Return to Flint with the Log book for your reward.<br><center>-----</center><br>Ye will not be believin' what misfortune has befallen me now!  No sooner have I gotten me Barley back, those goblins have gone and taken me log book!  How in the two dimensions am I supposted to keep up with all of tha supplies with no log book?  Of course, those lay about guards dinna see anything!<br><br>Listen, ye 've been a blessin' to ol' Flint in tha past so I wanta make ye another offer.  If'n ye will bring ol' Flint's book back ta 'im, I will give ye a keg o' me special brew!
1094971	'Tis a fine thing to do to a friend in need!  But so be it. 'Tis not the first time today ol' Flint has been let down. Won't be the last.
1094972	'Ave ye laid hold to ol' Flint's log book yet?  Oh, I'm sorry, I jes' figured ye would have it back by now... Carry on then!
1094973	In the center of the room you see an alter. There is a book lying on it.
1094974	This appears to be Flint's logbook.  It is not clear why the goblins were using it in a ritual.  Perhaps they were summoning a nefarious intention?
1094975	'Ave ye laid hold to ol' Flint's log book did ye?  Let me 'ave a look here!  Bloomin' savages!  They dog eared one o' the pages and bent the corner o' me cover! Blast!  Well, that's not fer you to be worryin' about.  Here be yer pay as promised a keg of me brew far yer own.  This keg is special made by me own design, ye can use it to refill that bottle I gave ye.  My brew is too strong for normal bottles, so I hope ye listened to ol' Flint and kept that bottle!

1094977	What's this I see?  A traveler fit to service me?
1094978	Travel into the Abyss and seek three samples of fertile dirt and three samples of bone.  Bring them to Gretchen for your reward.<br><center>-----</center><br>This place in dreams has called to me, it is to magic as a tree.  Passages stretch like limbs laden fair with a bounty of fruit in the form of a... err... reagents.<br><br>Ahem... Not that I would see you hurt, but the first thing I need is some Fertile Dirt.   Second I will need some bone, long forgotten, far from home.  Return to me with three of each, a special potion will I share with you this one time.
1094979	Reluctant ye are for our purposes to marry.  The future I've seen, and ye yet may ferry.
1094980	How bold ye are when encountering me, but yet ye must learn to count to three.
1094981	This day I saw in dreams of joy, these items do justify your employ.  The potion I give you is sticky and hot, if thrown to the ground it will bind to the spot.
1094982	This appears to be one of the reagents that Gretchen is looking for!
1094983	Done in the Name of Tinkering
1094984	Hail traveler.  Come here a moment.  I want to ask you somethin'.
1094985	Travel into the Abyss and find five floor traps using the Searching skill.  Collect the floor traps by using the Remove Trap skill.  Bring the components of the trap to Tobin for your reward.<br><center>-----</center><br>The name's Tobin, friend.  Specialist in all forms of tinkerin' that involves traps.  Only private contract stuff of course, royal projects an' the like.  I've joined this Society of Ariel Haven so that I might find any new devices that might be in this ancient place.<br><br>Say then, this old bird Dugan has been holding us up with a bunch of bureaucratic mumbo jumbo.  Something about dangerous creatures or some such.  Since you ain't under her thumb, why don't you go look around and bring ol' Tobin back any traps ye discover.  I'll need several specimens to work out the particulars.  In exchange, I will share with ye any tinkeries I discover from it.  What do you say?
1094986	So be it, friend.  I can understand if ye want to go it alone.  Let me know if ye change yer mind.
1094987	Hmm... Looks like traps are findin' you more than your're findin' the traps.  Keep it up though, by the looks of your clothes these traps will be a rare find!
1094988	Well done. These here are as fine a specimen of a trap if I've ever seen!  I've figured out how this thing works... I think.  Here I've made some notes so you can have these back.  I've fixed it up so it is easier to deploy.
1094989	You collect the components of this trap and put them in your backpack.

Retrieve Garamon’s book and return it to him.<br><center>-----</center><br>I have a task of great import and I seek a champion.  This ruin you see now was once beautiful and a place of prosperity and spirituality, but now it is a place of horrors.  If you travel to the center you will find the shaft of this volcano leading down to the lower parts of the Abyss.  I need a champion to go to the lower part of the Abyss and seek out a creature called a homunculus.  It will be easy to recognize because it is pretending to be me.  Do not be fooled!  This creature has a book of mine that I must get back!<br><br>There are several ways to reach the center of the abyss but there is magic that will not let you pass unless you first drink of the Wine of Compassion.  The path to the Wine of Compassion is a hard one and is not at all direct.  There are a series of ancient and magical transportation devices that you must find that will lead you to the Wine that you seek.  When you have proven yourself, the Treefellow Guardians will open the passage for you.
1094993	So be it traveler, but I must soon find a champion, or I fear all of this dimension will fall into darkness.
1094994	You must hurry. The danger is great, and there isn't much time!
1094995	So, now you have found my book!  The Wine of Compassion will be with you always and your future trips to the lower level of the Abyss can be quicker by knocking on the door in this hall.  It is barred from the other side but there is a Treefellow Guardian there who can let you pass.  Take this charm.  Your journey is only just beginning.
1094996	You have found yourself in the lower parts of the Abyss.  Now that you have found the way, you can go back to the old man by the door and tell him.

1095015	So be it, traveler.  I thank you for the courage you have shown in the past.  Speak to me again if you change your mind.
1095016	The goblins must learn again to fear humans and elves.  They can be cowed into submission, but if it is not done quickly they will become emboldened and start to venture out of the mountain to the villages and other settlements.  You must not let that happen.

1095193	Fires a bolt of nether energy at the Target, dealing chaos damage.
1095194	Conjures a Healing Stone that will instantly heal or attempt to cure the Caster when used. The amount of damage healed by the Healing Stone is determined by the caster's Mysticism as well as Imbuing or Focus skills (whichever is higher). The stone will disappear once all the healing energy is used up.
1095195	Attempts to remove a beneficial ward from the Target, chosen randomly. The chance to successfully Purge Magic is determined by a comparison between the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or imbuing (whichever is greater) skills, the Target's Magic Resistance skill and the level of the beneficial ward. If the target has no beneficial wards which meet the casters skill requirements to remove, the target is afflicted with a curse that increases their mana cost until they inflict damage on something. When the mana cost effect is dispelled, it will cause the target to take damage proportional to the duration of time the effect had been in place. The maximum duration of the effect is 8 seconds.
1095196	Temporarily enchants a weapon with a hit spell effect chosen by the Caster. If the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing skills are greater than 80, the Caster may hold the weapon while casting Magery or Mysticism spells.
1095197	Puts the Target into a temporary Sleep state. In this state, a Slept Target will attack, cast spells, and move at a much slower speed in addition to having hit chance and defense chance reduced considerably. A Slept Target will awaken if harmed or after a set amount of time. The Sleep duration is determined by a comparison between the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills and the Target's Magic Resistance skill.
1095198	Conjures a magical eagle that assaults the Target with its talons, dealing energy damage.
1095199	Conjures and animates a weapon that selects a Target to attack based off its combat strength and proximity. The Animated Weapon disappears after a set amount of time. The Animated Weapon's stats and duration are determined by the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills. Damage is determined by the Caster's Anatomy and Tactics skills. Requires 4 pet control slots.
1095200	Infuses the Caster with the essence of solid stone, giving a bonus to physical attacks and damage resistance, but reducing the Caster's movement, spell casting, and attack speed. The Stone Form may neutralize poison, strangle, bleed, sleep, and stat reduction effects. The Stone Form's effectiveness is determined by the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing skills (whichever is greater).
1095201	Allows the Caster to store a Mysticism spell in a Spell Stone. When the Caster uses the Spell Stone, the stored spell is instantly cast. The Caster must possess the spell in his spellbook. The highest Mysticism spell circle that can be stored in a Spell Stone is determined by the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills. Cooldown: 5 minutes.
1095202	Puts one or more Targets within a radius around the Target's Location into a temporary Sleep state. In this state, Slept Targets will be unable to attack or cast spells, and will move at a much slower speed. They will awaken if harmed or after a set amount of time. The Sleep duration is determined by a comparison between the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills and the Target's Magic Resistance skill.
1095203	Soothing winds attempt to neutralize poisons, lift curses, and heal a valid Target. The Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills determine the effectiveness of the Cleansing Winds.
1095204	Hurls a magical boulder at the Target, dealing physical damage. This spell also has a chance to knockback and stun a player Target. The stun chance is determined by a comparison between the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills and the Target's Magic Resistance skill.
1095205	The target is hit with an explosion of chaos damage and then inflicted with the spell plague curse. Each time the target is damaged while under the effect of the spell plague, they may suffer an explosion of chaos damage. The initial chance to trigger the explosion starts at 90% and reduces by 30% every time an explosion occurs. Once the target is afflicted by 3 explosions or 8 seconds have passed, that spell plague is removed from the target. Spell Plague will stack with other spell plagues so that they are applied one after the other.
1095206	Summons a storm of hailstones that strikes all Targets within a radius around the Target's Location, dealing cold damage.
1095207	Summons a gale of lethal winds that strikes all Targets within a radius around the Target's Location, dealing chaos damage. In addition to inflicting damage, each Target of the Nether Cyclone temporarily loses a percentage of mana and stamina. The effectiveness of the Nether Cyclone is determined by a comparison between the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing (whichever is greater) skills and the Magic Resistance skill of the Target.
1095208	Summons a colossal stone titan that selects a Target to attack based off its intelligence and proximity. The Rising Colossus disappears after a set amount of time. The Rising Colossus' stats, skills, and duration are determined by the Caster's Mysticism and either Focus or Imbuing skills (whichever is greater). Requires 5 pet control slots.

1112539	We need your assistance with a matter that is most grave. To the north, from within the Tomb of Kings, the Arisen are emerging each night to attack the Holy City.<br><br>Shortly after we unsealed the entrance to the Abyss, found in the depths of the Tomb, strange happenings began to occur. At first, there were only a few reports of strange noises coming from the Tomb of Kings late at night. Investigating the Tomb during the daytime uncovered nothing unusual, so we sent someone to seek out the source of these noises one night. When morning came and he had not returned, we knew something was amiss.<br><br>We sent word to the Royal City asking for help, but the following night, unspeakable evil erupted from the entrance to the Tomb! A defense of the city was quickly marshaled, but the Arisen proved to be quite powerful. Unfortunately, they are also persistent, as every night since then, this city, the original birthplace of our people, has faced wave after wave of Arisen. We know not the cause of the attacks, nor the source, as investigations by daylight yield little. We have been hard pressed just to defend the Elders here, much less push the Arisen back into the Tomb.<br><br>We could use your help in this! Either help defend the Holy City at night, or enter the Tomb of Kings itself and seek out the Arisen at their source. It is your choice to make, as you know your own abilities best. If you decide to enter the Tomb of Kings, you'll need to speak the words "ord" and "an-ord" to pass the Serpent's Breath.<br><br>Succeed in this task, and I shall reward you well.
1112540	To decide not to help would bring you great shame.
1112541	Help defend the Holy City or head down into the tombs!
1112542	Good work! Now return to Naxatilor.
1112543	You have proven yourself both brave and worthy! Know that you have both our gratitude and our blessing to enter the Abyss, if you so wish.<br><br>All who wish to enter must seek out the Shrine of Singularity to the North for further meditation. Only those found to be on the Sacred Quest will be allowed to enter the Abyss. I would advise that you seek out some of the ancient texts in the Holy City Museum, which you can find to the south, so that you might focus better while meditating at the Shrine. As promised, here is your reward.

1112676	You harvest magical resources from the creature and place it in your bag.
1112677	The creature is still recovering from the previous harvest. Try again in a few seconds.
1112678	You don't have enough crystal dust to make that.
1112679	You do not have enough scales to make that.
1112680	You realize that is not the correct answer.<br><br>You vow to study the Book of Circles again so that you might understand all that is required of you. Perhaps meditating again soon will bring the wisdom that you seek.<br>

1112692	Welcome back. I must remind you that we are still in great danger. Please help protect Ter-Mur from the Void Daemons.

1112699	You feed your chicken, but nothing happens. Maybe later!
1112700	Answering the last question correctly, you feel a strange energy wash over you.<br><br>You don't understand how you know, but you are absolutely certain that the guardians will no longer bar you from entering the Stygian Abyss.<br><br>It seems you have proven yourself worthy of La Insep Om.

1112706	This tastes good.
1112707	I thank you.
1112708	Your pack seems full, so I will put it at your feet.
1112709	Ha! You are inept!
1112710	You missed, fool!
1112711	Your aim is bad...
1112712	Surely you can do better than that blow!
1112713	You are no match for me!
1112714	Ouch! That scratched me!
1112715	Barely a flesh wound. Can't you do better?
1112716	You fight without discipline.
1112717	You lack focus. Surely you can do better!
1112718	Your anger blinds you. You will lose this battle.
1112719	A good blow on your part, but not enough!
1112720	Away with you!
1112721	I am too busy fighting to deal with you!
1112722	Alas, I cannot teach you anything.
1112723	I am too busy to teach you.
1112724	I cannot train you. I have more important things to do.
1112725	I do not train while I am working.
1112726	That is something I cannot teach you.
1112727	I cannot teach you, for you know more than I.
1112728	You have not learned enough of other ways to be taught this skill.
1112729	For less, I will teach you less.

1112798	Greetings.<br><br>Ever since one of those nasty boura crushed my leg, I haven't been up to my usual duties. My wife thinks that I'm getting to be too old to be out in the woods and down in the abyss as much as I was when I was younger. I'm a hunter, you see, and keeping dangerous creatures at bay is my responsibility. You look like you are strong enough to cull the boura herd. Perhaps you can start with some of the easier boura found across the river to the east. In exchange for your help, I can offer you some of my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients.
1112799	Are you sure you are not up to the hunt? Those boura may seem passive, but they have been known to maim unwary travelers who threaten them... or worse.
1112800	You need to cull more of the boura herd than that. They are found to the east, across the river.
1112801	I see that you have returned successful in your task. That is enough for today, but I will have more work for you in a bit if you wish to come back.

1112803	Greetings.<br><br>Ever since one of those nasty boura crushed my leg, I haven't been up to my usual duties. My wife thinks that I'm getting to be too old to be out in the woods and down in the abyss as much as I was when I was younger. I'm a hunter, you see, and keeping dangerous creatures at bay is my responsibility. Do you think you are strong enough to take on the packs of wild raptors that roam to the south outside of the city? Those raptor packs are getting out of control and have been attacking travelers to the Holy City. In exchange for your help, I can offer you some of my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients.
1112804	Are you sure you can't help? The route to the Holy City will be swarming with hungry raptors soon.
1112805	You're going to have to do better than that. You can find the raptors to the south, on the island before you get to the Holy City.
1112806	I see that you have returned successful in your task. That is enough for today, here is your reward. I will have more work for you in a bit if you wish to come back.

My wife thinks that I'm getting to be too old to be out in the woods and down in the abyss as much as I was when I was younger. I'm a hunter, you see, and keeping dangerous creatures at bay is my responsibility. The slith aren't particularly aggressive, but if we let them get out of hand, they'll start pushing the other wildlife out of the area. In exchange for your help killing some of them, I can offer you some of my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients.
1112808	Hunting slith may not be a story you'll be happy to tell your grandchildren about, but it needs to be done nonetheless.
1112809	There are still too many slith wandering around out there. Return when you've killed enough to make a difference.
1112810	I see that you have returned successful in your task. That is enough for today, here is your reward. I will have more work for you in a bit if you wish to come back.

1112823	Greetings, hunter.<br><br>You've proven yourself to be a capable hunter, able to hunt the lesser creatures without fail. My injury prevents me from coming with you, so I ask that you be careful with your next task. High plains boura are not to be taken lightly. They are territorial and will not hesitate to attack you on sight, so be prepared when you face them. You can find them roaming the high plains to the north of the Holy City. As usual, I will reward you with something from my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients. Do you think you are you ready?
1112824	The herd needs culling, are you sure you cannot do this?
1112825	You will need to kill more high plains boura than that.
1112826	I see that you are back, and apparently in one piece. This is good. Here is your reward, please return in a couple hours for another task.
1112827	Greetings, hunter.<br><br>You've proven yourself to be a capable hunter, able to hunt the lesser creatures without fail. My injury prevents me from coming with you, so I ask that you be careful with your next task. Toxic slith are quite dangerous foes, and will not hesitate to poison you if they are able. They can be found on the islands to the east and northeast. As usual, I will reward you with something from my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients. Do you think you are you ready?
1112828	It is not shameful, exactly, to admit that you cannot face such foes. If you change your mind, come back to me.
1112829	You can find the toxic slith on the islands to the east and northeast. Please be careful.
1112830	I see that you are back, and apparently in one piece. This is good. Here is your reward, please return in a couple hours for another task.
1112831	Greetings, hunter.<br><br>You have proven yourself to be a capable hunter, able to hunt the lesser creatures without fail. My injury prevents me from coming with you, so I ask that you be careful with your next task. There is a creature known as the fire ant, and it is a foe you will not want to take lightly. The insides of the insect react soon after contact with the air and burst into flame. As usual, I will reward you with something from my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients. Do you think you are you ready?
1112832	I understand that these fire ants make seem to be too much for you, but I'm confident that you will return eventually to help.
1112833	You'll need to slay more fire ants than that.
1112834	I see that you are back, and apparently in one piece. This is good. Here is your reward, please return in a couple hours for another task.
1112835	Greetings, hunter.<br><br>You have proven yourself to be a capable hunter, able to hunt the lesser creatures without fail. My injury prevents me from coming with you, so I ask that you be careful with your next task. To hunt a kepetch ambusher requires great skill and patience, as they spend most of their time lurking in the shadows awaiting unsuspecting prey. When you have reached an area where they are known to be, walk carefully, and listen carefully, and you will be successful. As usual, I will reward you with something from my wife's stock of imbuing ingredients. Do you think you are you ready?
1112836	Hunting that which cannot be easily seen is difficult. Return to me when you are ready.
1112837	You need to slay more kepetch ambushers for your task to be complete.
1112838	I see that you are back, and apparently in one piece. This is good. Here is your reward, please return in a couple hours for another task.
1112839	Greetings, my friend.<br><br>You have proven yourself to be a worthy hunter, ready to stalk the greatest of creatures and succeed. My injury is not healing this time, and I fear that my wife is right and my time on the hunt is near the end. Yet, I still have knowledge of what needs to be done, so I am pleased to continue to guide you if you so choose. Putrid undead gargoyles are not to be underestimated. Very capable at melee, they also posses nearly overwhelming magical ability. If that were not enough, any that approach them are overwhelmed with disgust and will violently retch many times.<br><br>I say this not to dissuade you from this task, but so that you can go prepared. Of course, I will reward you with ingredients from my wife's stock, but for this task they will be of the most valuable kind. Are you willing to slay these foul creatures?
1112840	I am sure that you have your reasons for delaying. Please return to me when you are ready.
1112841	I know it is difficult, but you must persevere in the face of this great threat. Can you imagine if these putrid undead gargoyles grew in number so as to overwhelm the guards and pour forth into Ter Mur?
1112842	You have returned, my friend, and from the look of you, I see that you have been successful in the hunt. I am pleased to offer you this reward. Please return tomorrow, after you've taken some time to rest and recuperate from this hunt. I will no doubt have something more for you to do then.
1112843	Greetings, my friend.<br><br>You have proven yourself to be a worthy hunter, ready to stalk the greatest of creatures and succeed. My injury is not healing this time, and I fear that my wife is right and my time on the hunt is near the end. Yet, I still have knowledge of what needs to be done, so I am pleased to continue to guide you if you so choose. The maddening horror is aptly named, and it is not to be underestimated. Magical in nature, it also has the ability to drain you of your mana. Of course, I will reward you with ingredients from my wife's stock, but for this task they will be of the most valuable kind. Are you willing to slay these foul creatures?
1112844	These maddening horrors need to be kept contained, so please return to me when you are ready.
1112845	You need to slay more maddening horrors. Please come back to me when you are finished.
1112846	You have returned, my friend, and from the look of you, I see that you have been successful in the hunt. I am pleased to offer you this reward. Please return tomorrow, after you've taken some time to rest and recuperate from this hunt. I will no doubt have something more for you to do then.

Yet, I still have knowledge of what needs to be done, so I am pleased to continue to guide you if you so choose. The dream wraith is a particularly difficult foe, as not only does it posses knowledge of magic and of death, it can invade your mind and turn the world into a living nightmare, freezing you with fear. It is also difficult to find, as it exists partially in the world of dreams, and thus is not always easy to see. Of course, I will reward you with ingredients from my wife's stock, but for this task they will be of the most valuable kind. Are you willing to slay these foul creatures?
1112848	The nightmarish creatures must be kept at bay, or we will find ourselves living our worst nightmares. Please return when you are able.
1112849	More of these dreadful beings need to be slain for your task to be complete.
1112850	You have returned, my friend, and from the look of you, I see that you have been successful in the hunt. I am pleased to offer you this reward. Please return tomorrow, after you've taken some time to rest and recuperate from this hunt. I will no doubt have something more for you to do then.

1112862	Greetings, my friend.<br><br>There are five great foes of the Gargoyle people, each of which is vastly more powerful than any other creature of which we know. If you find the lair of any of the five, I suggest great caution, as death will surely follow any foolish attempts to engage them in battle aloneIt will take a strong party of those with much experience in the hunt to take down one of the five - do not attempt such a feat without being prepared.<br><br>If you manage to face one of the final five and live, bring me a trophy from the creature and I shall reward you for your valorous deed.
1112863	It is not shameful to admit that you cannot face one of these great creatures. Perhaps another day you will find the courage to do so.
1112864	You only need to return to me with a trophy from one of the great creatures, and I shall reward you.
1112865	You have returned, and still in one piece, I see. A valorous deed such as this shall be rewarded, certainly, but know also that your name will be known by generations for what you have done this day.

1112873	Presumptuous, are we? You think i will just let you get your grubby hands on my clever inventions! I think not! If you want to learn how to create these wonders of mechanical life, you will have to prove yourself.

1112891	I have seen the end of days, my child. The final battles that edge ever closer haunt my dreams. Canst thou stand against the fate of this world? Will ye? If so, I shall aid thee with the gifts of those born upon a distant shore. Go forth! Slay the spawn of shadows! Bring unto me a Cloak of Corruption and the Threads of Life. I shall turn Fate itself aside and weave thee an Artifact of Healing... that thou might stand stalwart and strong against the coming nightfall.
1112892	Where is thine Cloak? Where art thine Threads?
1112893	Thou hast done well! Though the world forsake thee, know that greater forces act to preserve thee. Take this, then, and wear it well.
1112894	The end draws nigh, but for whom? Even a single soul such as thyself may tip the scales. Perhaps not. Yet, if thou be willing, then ye shall receive aid! Bring unto me a Cloak of Corruption and the Threads of Fate. I shall bind these remnants of power against the cloak's influence. I shall make thee an Artifact of War... that thou might destroy thine enemies and thwart the corrupters of men.
1112895	Dark falls low across the land - destroying the hopes and dreams of all. Wilt thou rise before the challenge, take up arms and fight the last fight? I shall aid thee, if thou choosest so. For this path alone holds the sweet promise of a future, a future made bright and glorious by the sacrifices of many come before. Bring unto me a Cloak of Corruption and the Threads of Thought. Indeed, I shall give thee an Artifact of Hope... thou thou might rise above the darkness, and never let it fall upon us again.
1112896	The time is at hand, wilt thou hear me?
1112897	It is time, wilt thou listen?

1112910	The voices that plagued you for so long have... vanished. Yet you feel as though what was once simply in your thoughts has now been made real in the world about you. Something is... wrong.
1112911	As you gently hold the shard it begins to glow - the stars shining within seem to sing to the beautiful world turning softly below. A vision overwhelms you of tranquil cities where all races, be they men, elves, orc or gargoyle, have overcome their natural selves and founded a civilization built upon harmony and peace. For a moment, one pure moment, you feel every joyous life within, and cry out for the beauty of it all...
1112912	The shard in your hand gives off a gentle sense of warmth, the stars inside twinkle merrily over a small world of oceans and clouds. As a familiar landmass comes slowly into view you see a vision of two great kingdoms. Even as they reach out to one another you sense their ultimate destiny, and one must surely pass away...
1112913	The shard seems to draw your eye inwards as you gaze upon the world within. The stars above seem to shine coldly
1112914	Destruction greets your eyes as you peer into the dark depths of the shard. The dead world below spins slowly, the stars above all but dark, the ruins of kingdoms littered across the face of the land as so many piles of ash. A vision of the people within reveals fear, uncertainty, and doubt clouding the minds of even the noblest of men, few though they are. Darkness has fallen upon this shard, consuming all who once lived peacefully within...
1112915	The shard cuts your hand and warm, wet blood seeps along its edges, obscuring the view within in a haze of crimson. A vision assaults you without warning, of war and death and terror. This world did not die for lack of Virtue, or the apathy of its inhabitants - no, this world was ripped asunder by the very forces of darkness that threaten your own. With this realization comes a feeling of joy

1112917	*Axem appears to be studying an old scroll*<br><br>...if I take the third letter in every tenth word, then add them together backwards, I should... Oh, hello there, I didn't see you come in. You look like an adventurous type, perhaps you have come across things in your travels that might look like bits of junk. Things like broken pottery laying around. I'm sure you have, but did not know what you were looking for.<br><br>I'll tell you what, if you bring me some ancient pottery fragments, I'll see what I can dig up for your trouble. What do you say?
1112918	Well, ok then. It is really your loss, as no merchant is going to give you a single gold piece for those fragments.
1112919	I really need at least ten fragments to be able to glean anything useful from them. Please come back when you have ten.
1112920	Aaah! I knew that you were one of those adventurous types. Quickly now, hand those over, I do not have all day to stand here chatting if I am going to start studying those fragments.
1112921	*As you approach, Axem seems completely unaware of you*<br><br>Ok, now if I substitute each symbol by the one thirteen places in front of it, I get... what? Who are... oh, my, forgive me. Greetings! It is good to see you again. I must apologize, I have been so busy trying to figure out the meaning of the symbols on the pottery fragments you brought me. So far, I have not gotten very far, but perhaps if I were able to cross reference these symbols with another source.<br><br>Let me think... yes, I think that would do. Have you seen any remnants of old scrolls laying about during your travels? I would reward you, of course, if you would bring them to me. Is it a deal?
1112922	I hope you change your mind! I have a feeling there is something important contained in these fragments that we have forgotten over time. Something very important, indeed.
1112923	I will need at least five remnants of an ancient scroll to be able to piece together anything useful from it.
1112924	*Once again, Axem is so completely engrossed in his work that he fails to notice you*<br><br>...sliding the penultimate symbol back to this position, subtracting the number of symbols in a row, leads to... hmm, absolutely nothing. Again.<br><br>*Axem jumps as he realizes you're standing next to him*<br><br>I thought you were my ex-wife there for a second. Whew! So, you have returned? With all that I have asked for? Fabulous, I'll get to work on these now. Here is your reward, now please leave me be.
1112925	*As you approach Axem, you realize that he is looking right at you for a change*<br><br>You thought you would sneak up on me again, did you? I saw you coming, so you will have to find amusement elsewhere today.<br><br>Alas, I could use your help though. I believe that I have the meanings for some of the symbols found on these ancient fragments, there is some relation to our modern alphabet, but there is just too much that has changed to say with absolute certainty.<br><br>While you were off gallivanting about, have you noticed any old tomes in out of the way places? We have a few here already, but they've already been translated and are not from the same era as the rest of what you have brought me. These bits and pieces will only allow me to get so far, I'm afraid. If you know where to find anything like that, will you bring it to me?
1112926	I am severely disappointed in you. I tell you that I am very close to solving the puzzle, and you say you are too busy to help? Pfah!
1112927	Are you going to bring me an untranslated ancient tome, or not? Now, where did I put my magnifying glass...
1112928	*Axem has his back towards you, so you walk quietly up to him and tap him on the shoulder.*<br><br>AAAAAAHHHHHH! Get away! You can't have... oh... my... it is you. I have told you that is not very nice, and yet you persist in attempting to frighten me. Well, it will not work, so go away.<br><br>Wait, what is that you have there? Is that... yes, I think it is! Give it here, now! I mean... will you please give that to me? I have something to give you in exchange that I think you will find was worth your efforts.

1112943	You must upgrade to Stygian Abyss in order to use this.
1112944	Ah, yes, welcome to our humble shop. Do you wish to buy some of our fine potions today, or perhaps have something of interest to sell?<br><br>No? Well, I do have some specialty goods for sale that may be of interest to you. Unfortunately, specialty goods require specialty ingredients, which can be harder to come by. I'm not the adventurous sort, so if you are interested, you'll have to bring them to me.<br><br>Pets can be finicky eaters at times, but I have just the solution for that. I call them 'Tasty Treats', and they're sure to please your pet. In fact, Fluffy will be so happy after eating one of these that you'll find that Fluffy's abilities are noticeably improved! Are you interested in some Tasty Treats?
1112945	Ah, perhaps another time then.
1112946	You will need to bring me five boura skins and a bit of dough. You can find the boura all over Ter Mur, though I have heard that the tougher variety have skin that is more likely to stay intact during its slaughter.
1112947	Welcome back. Did you bring the ingredients I asked for? Ah, good. Depending on the quality of the boura skins, I usually do not need all five to produce five tasty treats. You can consider what is left over as payment for my services. The rest, I shall use... for other purposes. I have other tasks to finish right now for the master, but you can return in a bit if you wish to purchase more.
1112948	Ah, yes, welcome to our humble shop. Do you wish to buy some of our fine potions today, or perhaps have something of interest to sell?<br><br>No? Well, I do have some specialty goods for sale that may be of interest to you. Unfortunately, specialty goods require specialty ingredients, which can be harder to come by. I'm not the adventurous sort, so if you are interested, you'll have to bring them to me.<br><br>Mistress Zosilem has recently discovered an efficient method of converting lesser metals in those that are more valuable. The elixirs that convert the more valuable metals are for our long term customers. That said, perhaps you are interested in purchasing a elixir that can turn up to 500 dull copper ingots into gold ones? I will need some specialty ingredients in addition to what we have in the shop. Of course, nothing one such as yourself cannot obtain with a small bit of effort.<br><br>Bring me five portions of congealed slug acid, and twenty gold ingots. I will need to inspect the ingots before I accept them, so give those to me before we complete the transaction.
1112949	Ah, perhaps another time then.
1112950	I will need twenty gold ingots and some congealed slug acid, which can be found on... can you guess? Yes, that's right. Acid slugs.
1112951	Hello, how may I help you? Oh, wait, you were interested in the elixir of gold conversion, right? If you have the materials I asked for ready, hand them over and I'll get to work on your elixir right away. After that, I have other tasks to finish for the mistress, but you can return in a bit if you wish to make another purchase.
1112952	Welcome back to our shop. As one of our valued customers, I assume that you are here to make a specialty purchase? Mistress Zosilem has authorized me to make available to you a very special elixir that is able to convert common iron into something a bit more valuable.<br><br>That we can make this available at all is due to some very cutting edge research that the mistress has been doing. In fact, the results are a bit unpredictable, but guaranteed to be worth your time. If you are interested, I'll need you to bring me twenty each of the lesser four colored ingots, as well as ten undamaged iron beetle scales. Does that sound good to you?<br><br>I will need to inspect the ingots before I accept them, so give those to me before we complete the transaction.
1112953	As you wish. Of course, stop by at any time if you find yourself in need of alchemy supplies, or for something a bit more rare.
1112954	I'll need you to bring me twenty each of the lesser four colored ingots, dull copper, shadow iron, copper and bronze, as well as ten undamaged iron beetle scales.
1112955	I see that you have returned. Did you still want the elixir of metal conversion? Yes? Good, just hand over the ingredients I asked for, and I'll mix this up for you immediately. I'll be busy for a couple hours, but return after that if you wish to purchase more.
1112956	It is good to see you. As one of our valued customers, Mistress Zosilem has given me permission to offer you another special elixir, one able to convert the more common shadow iron into valuable agapite. I'll need twenty agapite ingots and some seared fire ant goo for the mixture. Are you interested?<br><br>I will need to inspect the ingots before I accept them, so give those to me before we complete the transaction.
1112957	As always, feel free to return to our shop when you find yourself in need. Farewell.
1112958	I will need twenty agapite ingots and some seared fire ant goo which, unsurprisingly, can be found on fire ants.
1112959	Good to see you again, have you come to bring me the ingredients for the elixir of agapite conversion? Good, I'll take those in return for this elixir I made earlier. I'll be busy the rest of the day, but come back tomorrow if you need more.

1112963	Who dares disturb me? Ah, yes, I know who you are. Thepem has told me that you do a great deal of business with us, and are to be trusted with some of our more, shall we say... exotic... mixtures. So, let's get down to business, shall we?<br><br>Tasty treats are the weakest of our pet enhancing mixtures, but through much experimenting, I have discovered that more powerful aids can be created. However, the collection of these ingredients is not exactly healthy for one's karma. You see, in order to create a batch of deliciously tasty treats, sure to inspire your pet beyond what it is normally capable of, I will need you to bring me five boura skin, five fairy dragon wings and some dough. Hmm... no, make that ten fairy dragon wings, as I believe that to be a fair price for my time and knowledge.
1112964	You are not interested? That is fine, but understand that I shall vigorously deny it if word of my exotic elixirs gets out because of you.
1112965	You need to bring me five boura skin, ten fairy dragon wings and some dough.
1112966	You have returned, and from the bulge in your pack, I see that you have something for me. Hand it over, and I will give you a batch of deliciously tasty treats in return. Return in a bit if you wish to do business with me again.
1112967	Who dares disturb me? Ah, yes, I know who you are. Thepem has told me that you do a great deal of business with us, and are to be trusted with some of our more, shall we say... exotic... mixtures. So, let's get down to business, shall we?<br><br>Are you perhaps interested in bettering your knowledge of the fine art of alchemy? If so, I have discovered a method in which to impart a small bit of alchemy knowledge into an arcane gem. You will need to bring me an arcane gem, and ten undead gargoyle horns for the mixture, as well as two kegs of potions for my time and knowledge. How about a keg of total refreshment potions and a keg of greater poison potions? I'll need to inspect them first, of course, so just hand them to me before we complete the transaction. Shall we make a deal?
1112968	You are not interested? That is fine.
1112969	Bring me an arcane gem and five undead gargoyle horns for the mixture, as well as a keg of total refreshment potions and a keg of greater poison potions. I'll need to inspect the kegs first, of course.
1112970	You have returned, and from the bulge in your pack, I see that you have something for me. Hand it over, and I will give you an infused alchemist's gem. I will need to extract more essence from my... well, you do not need to worry about that. Return in a bit if you wish to obtain another one.
1112971	You have returned, no doubt to purchase some more of my exotic elixirs. I do not trust just anyone with these elixirs, so know that you are in a small circle of trust.<br><br>It is unfortunate when Fluffy dies fighting a chicken lizard, but accidents do happen from time to time. Perhaps you would be interested in an elixir that could prolong the life of your pet in battle? If you were to bring me five boura skins, ten leather wolf skins, ten undamaged iron beetle scales, and some dough to hold the mixture together, I could provide you with a vial of an elixir that is guaranteed to help your pet absorb damage. Are you interested?
1112972	I see. Well, I am quite busy, so you may show yourself out now if you please.
1112973	Bring me five boura skins, ten leather wolf skins, ten undamaged iron beetle scales, and some dough.
1112974	Good, you have returned with the ingredients I need. I'll take those from you in exchange for a vial of armor essence. Return in a couple hours if you wish me to whip up another batch for you.
1112975	You have returned, no doubt to purchase some more of my exotic elixirs. I do not trust just anyone with these elixirs, so know that you are in a small circle of trust.<br><br>Lets get down to why you are here. I have the ability to create a mixture that is able to turn regular copper ingots into much rarer verite. To do this, I will need twenty verite ingots and five undead gargoyle medallions. They are made with verite, but were fashioned using a dark magic that I do not understand... yet. Until then, I will need some so that I can crush them and dissolve the powder into the elixir of verite conversion. Hopefully you are strong enough to collect these.<br><br>Oh, and before I forget... I will need to inspect the ingots before I accept them, so give those to me before we complete the transaction.
1112976	Undead gargoyles are quite powerful foes, but if you change your mind, come and see me.
1112977	Bring me five undead gargoyle medallions and twenty verite ingots.
1112978	It is good to see that you have returned in one piece. After all, good customers like you do not grow on trees. Yes, that was a joke.<br><br>*Zosilem opens her mouth in what approximates a smile, though it reminds you of a mythical creature you once read about called a 'grue'*<br><br>I will take those ingredients in exchange for this elixir of verite conversion. If you come back in a couple hours, I can make more if you wish.
1112979	Welcome back, friend. It is good to see you again. Are you here to purchase the results of my latest research? I believe you find this very exotic elixir to be quite impressive.<br><br>I discovered that the very nature of the fairy dragon is the reason that deliciously tasty treats have such an impact on any pet that eats one. What is this nature, you ask? I do not know what to call it, but for lack of a better term, let us say that it is extracting its good nature that produces the results we want.<br><br>Of course, some of the more narrowminded amongst us might consider it cruel to hunt these creatures, but what do they know? Anyhow, back to what I was saying. I have nearly perfected a recipe for what I shall call the irresistibly tasty treat. While causing the pets natural attributes to increase for a short amount of time, it also has the effect of putting the pet into a frenzy, allowing it to inflict greater damage on your foes.<br><br>This new mixture requires the usual five boura skin and dough, but also ten pieces of treefellow wood, which when burned to an ash using a technique I would prefer not to mention where it can be overheard, gives the mixture its potency. Oh, also, the wood must come from a treefellow guardian. That is important. If you can obtain these things for me, I will give you one irresistibly tasty treat in return. Interested, friend?
1112980	Please feel free to return to my shop at any time, for any reason. It is good to talk with you, even if you do not make a purchase.
1112981	I will need five boura skins and some dough, as well as ten treefellow wood from a treefellow guardian.
1112982	Good, you have returned with what we need. Quickly now, hand that over before someone sees what you have, and I shall give you an irresistibly tasty treat in return. I am busy for the rest of the day, but if you come back tomorrow, I can make more if you wish.
1112983	Welcome back, friend. It is good to see you again. Are you here to purchase the results of my latest research? I believe you find this very exotic elixir to be quite impressive.<br><br>The holy grail of alchemy used to be creating gold from a lesser metal, but even my apprentice knows how to do that. No, today the ultimate goal is the conversion of lesser metal into pure valorite. My most secret recipe allows me to do just that. Bronze becomes valorite! I would not reveal this to you if I did not have confidence that you will be discreet.<br><br>The catch is that the ingredients may be hard to come by. Unfortunately, the only source that I am aware of are putrid undead gargoyles. I will need five of their infused glass staves, enough so that when I crush the thickest part of one into a fine powder, I have enough to react with the twenty valorite ingots you also need to obtain. I will not bore you with the details, but the resulting elixir is capable of turning bronze into pure valorite! Sound interesting?<br><br>Of course, I will need to inspect the ingots before I accept them, so give those to me before we complete the transaction.
1112984	I do not blame you, putrid undead gargoyles are not to be trifled with. Return if you change your mind, friend.
1112985	Remember, this needs to be kept secret at all costs, but I will need five infused glass staves from putrid undead gargoyles, and twenty bronze ingots.
1112986	Quickly now, do not just stand there holding those staves where anyone can see! I will just take those... and here is your elixir of valorite conversion. It is very valuable, so watch to make sure that you are not followed when you leave the shop. I am busy for the rest of the day, but if you come back tomorrow, I can make more if you wish.

1113246	Welcome to my little shop!<BR><BR>Don't you just love these beautiful carpet samples? Look at these embroidery patterns! And the intricate knotwork! It was sure worth every gold piece I paid to have these shipped from Vesper.<BR><BR>What's that? No, no, I'm sorry, these aren't for sale! I'm working towards recreating each of these gorgeous styles myself, you see, and just wanted to show my future customers what they might one day expect! By the skies though, how do I even begin learning these new patterns?<BR><BR>I know! If you help me get started, you could be one of my first customers! Yes, that's it - I need to get into the mind of a Britannian crafter, so I need Britannian wool! Real, natural wool, mind you, none of the cheap sort you see on the vendors.<BR><BR>Maybe you could find some by shearing some of those... what do you call them? Sherp? Sheeple?

1113253	Wow! Isn't this amazing? It's so soft, so pure - surely this is the key to my efforts!<BR><BR><I>Laifem skillfully spins the wool into a beautiful ball of white yarn - before you know it, she's staring down at her first attempt to weave a Britannian carpet</I>

I guess I thought this would be a bit easier.<BR><BR><I>She reaches up and twists on her ear a little, obviously deep in thought</I><BR><BR>You know... I think I need some professional assistance! There's a tailoring shop in Vesper called, hrm, "The Spinning..." "The Spinning..." something or other. Sorry, I just don't have a head for all those clever Britannian shop names.<BR><BR><I>*laughs*</I><BR><BR> I'm sure someone there could help, do you think you could deliver a letter of introduction for me?

1113258	There should be a man, er, a human one at that, who owns a tailoring shop in Vesper. Maybe he can help me?

My apologies, I just don't have a knack for those Gargish names you know!<BR><BR>Regardless, please take this back to the young lady, if you would be so kind.<BR><BR>Best regards!
1113262	Oh dear, truly? I'm sure she'd be very pleased to have this, and I don't have the means to journey there myself.<BR><BR>How very, very unfortunate...
1113263	Dermott wishes you to deliver the book "Mastering the Art of Weaving" to Laifem so she learn the ways of Britannian weaving.
1113264	This is perfect! Thank you so, so much!<BR><BR><I>Laifem eagerly begins reading the book while pacing about the room</I><BR><BR>Yes, yes I see. <I>*nods*</I> And the loops are done in a... with mohair knots... <I>*her fingers begin weaving idly in the air as she thinks*</I> and then to finish off the tassels I just...<BR><BR>This is everything I need to begin weaving my very own decorative carpets. You see, I won't just make the larger carpets, I'm going to make them in smaller pieces that can be put together to make any size or combination! Isn't that wonderful?
1113265	You have succeeded in aiding Laifem's attempts to master Britannian weaving, and can now access her inventory of decorative carpets!

1113472	Your pet has been kicked out of the room. This is not a stable!
1113473	The item already has that property imbued at that intensity.
1113474	This is proof of the death of one the five great foes of the Gargoyle people! You will surely be rewarded if you seek out the well-known hunter, Percolem, and present him with this trophy. Percolem can usually be found in his favorite tavern in the Royal City, just west of the market.
1113475	Perhaps another day you will find the time to travel to the Royal City.
1113476	Greetings, my friend. What have you brought me?<br><br>I see! No less than a trophy from one of the five great foes of the Gargoyle people, each of which is vastly more powerful than any other creature of which we know. A valorous deed such as this shall be rewarded, certainly, but know also that your name will be known by generations for what you have done this day.
1113477	Take this trophy to Percolem, the Hunter. He can be found in the Royal City, in his favorite tavern just to the west of the market.
1113478	You've inversed the state of your gem. You must neutralize it!
1113479	Hello again!<br><br>This is Part II of my experiment. Beyond these doors is a challenge for those carrying an Experimental Gem.
1113480	INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>Activate the Gem to start the self-destruct timer. You have 30 minutes to reach the final room.
1113481	Each room has colored areas matching various states:<br>White = Cold <br>Pink = Warm <br>Blue = Freezing<br>Red = Blazing
1113482	Green = Poison<br>Orange = Cure<br>Dark Green= Lethal<br>Brown=Greater Cure<br><br>Your gem's state will cycle randomly through these
1113483	colors. Each time the gem shifts, you must enter the colored region that will bring your gem back to neutral state (grey).
1113484	Failing when the gem reaches the extreme of any state get you expelled from the room and you will have to start over. The self-destruct
1113485	timer will not reset.<br><br>Once you reach the final room, place your gem in the box to receive your reward.

(Pull weeds by double clicking them)  When you find it, return it to him for your reward. <br><center>-----</center><br>I hate to trouble you, but sometimes a problem needs a plow and sometimes it needs a sword.  I am good with a plow, but terrible with a sword.<br><br>I have been plagued with a strange weed for some time.  Every day I have to clean them out of my garden and carry them away with my pitch fork.  Yesterday I was working there and… well, I must have nodded off because when I woke my pitchfork was gone!<br><br>I have heard talk of thieves who seek treasure in the sacred tomb, but I really don’t think they took my pitchfork, in fact I think it just got lost in the weeds!<br><br>I would find it myself, but now that we are so close to the edge of the world, many wild creatures are lurking about and some might be hiding in these weeds.  I’ve seen the creatures that have been roaming these parts recently and I fear for my life!  The problem is, if I don’t get my crop in the ground soon, we won’t make it through the winter.  Will you help?
1113501	I understand.  I certainly don’t want you to do something you don’t want to do.
1113502	Did you find my pitchfork?  I'm sure it is under those weeds somewhere.  It was a gift from King Draxinusom when he assigned me this job, I can’t bear to lose it!
1113503	Oh, thank you!  Here is your reward as promised.  I will get right back to work in a few minutes.

1113772	A Little Something
1113773	You want some basic imbuing ingredients, the kind that can be obtained from the beasts of Ter Mur? Well, I can help you. I usually don’t trade in such low end items, and I’m not sure why you cannot hunt them down yourself, but today you are in luck. If you will bring me something of which I do have a need, perhaps a piece of brilliant amber, I shall reward you with what I can find laying around. What exactly, I can’t tell you, as I do not have time to inventory such things.
1113774	Well, okay, if that is what you wish.
1113775	We have agreed to trade one piece of brilliant amber for some of the lesser imbuing ingredients. Bring that to me, and I shall uphold my part of our bargain.
1113776	Well, it is not the most brilliant piece of amber, but I suppose it shall do. Here is a bag with the ingredients I have found. In fact, I found more of these lesser imbuing ingredients than I believed I possessed, so return to me if you wish to make another trade.
1113777	The Exchange
1113778	Hello there! Hail and well met, and all of that. I must apologize in advance for being so impatient, but you must help me! You see, my mother and my eldest sister are visiting soon, and I haven’t seen them in quite awhile, so I want to present them both with a surprise when they arrive.<br><br>My sister absolutely adores white chocolate, but gargoyles don’t seem to care for it much, so I haven’t been able to find any here. It was recently my mother’s birthday, and I know that she would love some finely crafted gargish jewelry, but the jeweler hasn’t had her favorite jewel in stock for quite some time. If you could help me obtain five pieces of white chocolate and one dark sapphire, I will reward you with a bag of hard to obtain imbuing ingredients.
1113779	Oh, no, you must help me! Please say that you will!
1113780	Remember, I need five pieces of white chocolate, and one dark sapphire. Please do hurry!
1113781	Oh, thank you so very much! I cannot begin to thank you enough for helping me find these presents. Here is your reward. You’ll have to excuse me while I set this dark sapphire in a setting that will best highlight the cut. Farewell!
1113782	A Worthy Proposition
1113783	Hello, welcome to the shop. I don't own it, but the gargoyles here are as keen to learn from me as I am from them. They've been helping me with the work on my latest invention, but I am short some parts. Perhaps you could help me?<br><br>I have heard that the bamboo flutes of the Tokuno Islands are exceptionally strong for their weight, and nothing can beat elven fletching for strength in holding them together. If you would bring me, say, ten bamboo flutes and some elven fletching, I have some valuable imbuing ingredients I’ll give you in exchange. What do you say?
1113784	Well, if you change your mind, I’ll be here.
1113785	Hmm, what is that? Oh yes, I would like you to bring me ten bamboo flutes and some elven fletching for my fly… er, my invention.
1113786	These are of fine quality! I think they will work just fine to reinforce the floor of the basket. What’s that? Did I say basket? I meant, bakery! Yes, I am inventing a, um, floor for a bakery. There is a great need for that, you know! Ok, now please leave so I can get back to work. Thank you, bye, bye!
1113787	Unusual Goods
1113788	Psst. Do you want to buy something rare and valuable? Yes? Good. I have in my possession an imbuing ingredient that is highly sought after. If you wish to make a trade, it will not come cheaply. Provide me with two perfect emeralds and one piece of crystalline blackrock, and what is in this box shall be yours.
1113789	It is your choice, but do not speak of this to anyone else.

1113968	Dear Tomas,<br><br>Jared has not returned home since he last went to work in his lab 2 days ago. As you know, he had been working on a special project. His behaviour changed greatly as his project progressed. I have turned every stone but no
1113969	one seems to know where he might be. I’m worried sick. Any information or insight you may have would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>The bearer of this letter is assisting us in the search. Please share any information you have, however trivial it seems.
1113970	Help on locating his secret lab would be especially welcomed.<br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>Eliza
1113971	Your naughty twin turns you into a pile of maggots. Yuck!
1113972	Your naughty twin teleports you away with a naughty laugh!
1113973	I am sorry, but I cannot discuss with anyone not officially on this case. If you have proof that you are, please provide it!
1113974	Ah! Eliza sent you! Of course, I will assist any way I can. Ask me any question.

1113981	My Love,<br><br>I am sorry I had to postpone our rendez-vous again. But this time it’s truly worth it! That tinker Jared will be giving me a lot of money just to help him test children toys for Hallows’ Eve! You should come as well! Maybe
1113982	we can convince him he needs an extra helper and you could make some gold too. And then we would have enough to elope like we always wanted!<br><br>The lab is well hidden and the guard won’t let you in without permission so bring this note as he may ask
1113983	for it. In one of the caves at the mining camp north from here, you’ll find a big grey skull. Say “loki” near the skull and it will take you to me. <br><br>See you soon!<br><br>Isham

1113994	DAY 1<br>I finally managed to get the Hag's morph recipe. I'm eager to see if it works as well as I hope. If I succeed, Tomas will be so proud of me! He will be blown away!
1113995	DAY 2<br>I retained the services of Leto and Carl to be the first testers. Something went wrong. They morphed as was intended but I can't bring them back to their human form.
1113996	skeleton halloween costume
1113997	DAY 3<br>Sam and Laura drank some of my modified potion. It almost worked. I'm close, I can feel it! Leto and Carl are getting worse though. They're growling like beasts...
1113998	DAY 4<br>Leto and Carl are gone. They don't seem to have a shred of humanity left. Sam and Laura will be the same soon. How did it come to this? Isham volunteered to help. He needs the
1113999	money to elope with his belle. I shouldn't but I'm so close! And if I succeed, it will surely also help bring back the others to their original form. I cannot give up now.
1114000	DAY 7<br>They are all gone. I saw Leto in Despise with the Trolls. The others too have joined creatures of their type. The gypsies will not speak to me. They have finally realized that whatever I'm doing
1114001	is bad. It wasn't meant to be! I couldn't bear to face Lydia. This is my last attempt. This must work or all is lot. If it fails, I hope my beloved wife will forgive me.

1114011	Amateurs!! That's what happens when you mess with things you don't understand. Yes, I can Cure that.
1114012	If you want my help, you must first bring me a sample of what's ailing the patient.
1114013	Magical Herbs
1114014	moon grass
1114015	MOON GRASS<br>Of all seasonal plants, it is one of the most powerful. It grows around graveyards for a few days around Hallows Eve. When used on the corpse of a monster, one has a chance of
1114016	harvesting corporeal residue. The stronger the creature it was harvested from, the more potent the residue will be. Four grams of residue suffice to make a corporeal essence. Those are a wonder as
1114017	well. If you apply the essence on yourself you will temporarily be morphed into a random creature, based on the potency of the residue used to make your essence. The effects are amazing.
1114018	You can see things you couldn't perceive as a human, other creatures also leave you be, thinking you're one of them. But beware!! If you sustain damage or attack any other creature, the effects will
1114019	wear off! Just like moon grass, the corporeal essence can only be used so many times before it's used up so use it wisely!<br><br>So why do all this? For the Lingering Souls
1114020	of course! As a monster if you roam in dungeons, you will run into red lights flickering. It is the lingering souls of the dead. Capture them with a soul harvester. Once full, use the flask at an alchemy table
1114021	to turn it into crystallized essence. It will turn into one of three things:<br><br>BLUE CRYSTAL<br>Cures any disease or ailment. Very effective against morphing.
1114022	RED CRYSTAL<br>Used to make stable monster costumes.<br><br>GOLD CRYSTAL<br>Used to summon a Harbinger. Not for the faint of heart!
1114023	You collect a sprig of moon grass and put it in your backpack.
1114024	Select the alchemy table you want to process this on.
1114025	You haven't harvested enough souls to do this yet.
1114026	Your recommended shard is:
1114027	There are no resources left. Try again in a few minutes.
1114028	You harvest the last resources from this plant.
1114029	Select the corpse you wish to use this on.
1114030	You gather the residue and place it in your backpack.
1114031	This creature has already been drained.

1114036	This looks like a very potent cure for a rare illness.
1114037	Oh my!! I've seen this before! Beware if you use it. It summons a fiendish creature!
1114038	You have turned in ~1_COUNT~ red crystallized essence. Turn in ~2_NUM~ more to get a reward.
1114039	Thank you!! For every 5 red crystallized essences you bring me, I shall give you another reward!
1114040	Administer it to Jared or one of his helpers. It should slowly help restore them to their old self.
1114041	This will summon a formidable creature. Make sure to have friends with you when you do!
1114042	Bring this to Tomas. He can use it. That's what Jared was trying to accomplish.
1114043	The Toymaker might have a use for this.
1114044	You apply the cure and your patient seems a little better.
1114045	My savior!! I never thought I would be back to my old self again!! I'm eternally in your debt!

1114581	bending necks and extending wings, lifting black claws and allowing valiant fighters to ride forth and win an arisen battle. <br><br>The increasing winds
1114582	silence the sounds of combat, and they fight, standing their ground like mothers protecting their children, bright armor flashing as each one falls.
1114583	A cold autumn's evening with misty fog cradles a dozen battered corpses of knights, creasing them in currents of winds that run deep in the foothills of the desolate valley.
1114584	Dragons glide like silent angels, circling around and around, then calling like banshees
1114585	bending their necks and extending wings, lifting black claws and pinching the sacred ground and new eternal home. <br><br>The dying winds whistle among the dead in somber
1114586	procession, and they lie, grasping weapons to protect themselves like knights still in battle, shattered armor shining like newly born stars.

1114590	The first bear did swim by day,<br>And it did sleep by night,<br>It kept itself within its cave<br>And ate by starry light.
1114591	The second bear it did cavort<br>'Neath canopies of trees,<br>And danced its strange bearish sort<br>Of joy for all to see.
1114592	The first bear, well, 'twas hunted,<br>And today adorns a floor.<br>Its ruggish face has been dented<br>By footfalls and the door.
1114593	The second bear did step once<br>Into a mushroom ring,<br>And now does dance the dunce<br>For wisps and unseen things.
1114594	So do not dance, and do not sleep,<br>Or else be led astray!<br>For bears all end up six feet deep<br>At the end of Samlethe's day.
1114595	My employers have oft taken me into this den of hideous creatures, and I thought that it behooved me to write down what I know of it, now that I am retired from the life of an adventurer
1114596	for hire.<br><br> Deceit was once a temple to forgotten powers of old. It was taken over by mages who eventually were driven out by the depredations of
1114597	their own evil lackeys. However, many of the magical traps and devices that they placed for their defenses remain, particularly those the wizards used to protect their treasures.
1114598	The dungeon is mystically linked by crystal balls placed in different locations. These magical orbs do transmit speech, and even have memory of things that have been said near them. No doubt
1114599	they once served as a warning system.<br><br> Be wary of a brazier that giveth warning when approached: thou canst use it to summon deadly creatures.
1114600	There be a tantalizing chest, undoubtedly full of treasure, that cannot be reached save past a complex set of pressure plates that trigger deadly spikes. As I never had sufficient folk with me
1114601	to unlock the puzzle, I never obtained the riches that awaited there.<br><br> Do not investigate the iron maidens too closely, for they make suck you within them!
1114602	There is one place where a deadly trap can only be disarmed by making use of a statue that cleverly conceals a lever.<br><br> Oft one encounters the deadly exploding toadstool
1114603	the ones in Deceit are deadlier than most, as they explode continually. Likewise, the very pools of water and slime on the floor may poison thee.
1114604	The most magical device in the dungeon is a mystical bridge that can only be triggered by a lever embedded in the floor. Be wary, however, for the bridge thus created doth burst into
1114605	flame when one passeth across it!

1114607	Llamas are curious beasts, shaggy and sought after for their wool, yet of a curiously arrogant disposition reflected in their eyes. They live in mountainous areas, though who may have first
1114608	tamed them is lost in the mists of history.<br><br> 'Tis a well-known fact that llamas can indeed be tamed, and used as grazing animals, for their meat, and of course
1114609	for their wool. Yet 'tis lesser known that their ornery disposition and tendency to spit at those they dislike makes them appealing guard creatures as well, though they have little sound with which
1114610	to sound an alarum.
1114611	This volume was sponsored by donations from Lord Blackthorn, ever a supporter of understanding the other sentient races of Britannia.<br><br>---
1114612	Wisps are the most intelligent of the nonhuman races inhabiting Britannia. 'Tis claimed by the great sages that someday we shall be able to converse with them openly in our native
1114613	tongue -- indeed, we must hope that wisps learn our language, for it is not possible for humans to pronounce wispish!<br><br> The wispish language seems to only contain one
1114614	vowel, the letter Y. However, the letters W, C, M, and L seem to be treated grammatically as vowels, and in addition every letter is followed by what sounds to the human ear like a
1114615	glottal stop. It is possible that the glottal stop is considered a vowel as well.<br><br> Wisps do make use of what sounds to us like pitch and emphasis shifts
1114616	similar to exclamations and questions.<br><br> The average word in wispish seems to consist of three phonemes and three glottal stops, plus possibly a pitch shift.
1114617	It often sounds like a fire burning or crackling. Some have speculated that what we are analyzing is in fact nothing more than the very air crackling near the wisp's glow, and not
1114618	language, but this is of course unlikely.
1114619	In a time before time, the Gods that Be assembled a group of artisans, craftsmen and lore masters (for, yes, even in those days, art existed) to create the world of Sosaria. To this
1114620	group, the gods gave a tiny world, Rytabul, in which to test their works, to see if they were of the quality desired for the true world in which they would be placed. And though the
1114621	gods were tight fisted with their gold, this small crew worked hard and long, and were happy in their tasks.<br><br> A small corner of Rytabul had been claimed
1114622	by the artisan Selrahc the Slow. Though he was not the fastest of the assembled workers, the gods smiled upon his work, even presenting him with a mystic talisman proclaiming his work the
1114623	best among the newer artisans. And so Selrahc went about his business, creating hundreds of designs which would one day add color and variety to Sosaria.
1114624	One day a stranger appeared to Selrahc. His chest was bare and he wore the trousers of the brightest green, and wherever he went, plants grew in his footsteps. This caused Selrahc no
1114625	end of trouble, the stranger always looking over his shoulder, and the plants sprouting in places Selrahc required to ply his art. And so Selrahc approached the stranger and bade him speak. But
1114626	this man in green remained silent. Selrahc pleaded with the stranger to give his name, and would he please leave Selrahc to his work. But this mysterious stranger remained mute.
1114627	This angered Selrahc mightily. Who was this silent man, interfering with tasks the gods themselves had entrusted to Selrahc? In an attempt to embarass this interloper, Selrahc stole
1114628	his green trousers, leaving him naked and open to comments about his very manhood, and still the stranger would not speak, would not leave this tiny corner of Rytabul.
1114629	Vexed to his very limits, Selrahc took his war axe and smote the silent one mightily, again and again, until the silent stranger ran away, having never said a word, and never showed himself in
1114630	Rytabul again.<br><br> Thus endeth the tale of the bold stranger.
1114631	<br>
1114632	I have not much to tell about dragons. The sole time I approached one with an eye towards taming it, my initial attempts at calming it met with failure. It fixed a massive beady eye upon
1114633	me, and began its slithering approach, intending no doubt to insert me into its maw and bear down with its teeth.<br><br> However, as I was
1114634	engaged in what remains to this day the most terrifying combat of my life, the dragon suddenly whirled as if in a panic, ran a short distance, took off into the air, then transformed into a
1114635	whirlwind. Lastly, it exploded, showering gouts of black blood and heaving, stinking flesh upon miles of countryside. The fireball was massive enough to light a city I should surmise.
1114636	I never did discover the exact cause of this strange behavior, except to assume that it was not typical for this reptilian species. My best guesses revolve around a magical fracture in the
1114637	nature of reality, which is far too esoteric a territory for one of my limited scholarship.<br><br> Hence my basic advice to those who seek to tame a dragon-be sure
1114638	that thou hast mastered the twin skills of taming animals, and running away very very fast.
1114639	There are ten major trade associations that operate legitimately in the lands of Britannia and among its trading partners. Many of these guilds are divided into local or specialty
1114640	subguilds, who use the same colors but vary the heraldic pattern.<br><br> There are many lesser trade associations that have closed membership, and one can join only by
1114641	invitation. "Beltran's Guide to the Guilds" is the definitive text on the full range of guilds and other associations in Britannia, and I heartily recommend it.
1114642	In what follows I have attempted to bring together the known information regarding these guilds. I offer thee the name, typical membership, heraldic colors, known specialty
1114643	organizations within the larger guild, and any known affiliations to other guilds, which often occur because of trade reasons.

1114659	Your New Aquarium
1114660	Les Bilgewater
1114661	Welcome to the, wonderful world of aquarium ownership. With a little time and skill our aquarium can become a work of art!
1114662	Catching Fish:<br> You will need to aquire a fishing net, and a number of fish bowls, from your local fisherman.<br><br> To use the net, select it from your backpack,
1114663	and cast it into shallow water. Then we wait.<br><br> The fish will be so happy to be in your aquarium, they will jump right into your fish bowl when caught!
1114664	Just take them home and pour them into your aquarium, and BING! You have a happy new addition to your collection!
1114665	Caring for our Underwater Allies:<br> Fish need clean water and food to survive.<br><br> Our aquarium comes with a status monitoring aid. Must be Magic!
1114666	Just look at the front of your aquarium(mouse over). See the helpful and friendly guide? It tells how much food and water is needed to maintain, and improve the quality of your tank.
1114667	You dont want to overfeed your fish very often. In fact, you only want to feed them every other day. But, remember to keep the water strong and healthy, and add more on a regular basis to
1114668	keep your aquarium a pretty, sparkely blue.<br><br> Well, I hope you get as much enjoyment, collecting a beautiful array of our fine, finned, friends from the sea, as I do!
1114669	Happy Fishing!

1114672	'Twas a sight to see, the sunlight falling lightly on the sandstone walls of Trinsic 'pon a morning in spring.<br><br> Children ran along the parapets and walkways,
1114673	their laughter and running providing music to the daybreak, despite their oft-ragged clothing.<br><br> And I was one of those young ones, letting my joy rise up to the skies.
1114674	Little did we all know of the darker days that would lie ahead, for we were too young.<br><br> Had we but gained access to the quiet councils held in the
1114675	Knight tower as it faced the sea, councils lit by candlelight and worry, we would have learned more of the fears of imminent attack from the forest, where foul creatures born of dank caves and
1114676	darkness were marauding ever more often into the lands around Trinsic's moat.<br><br> But we were children! The parapets and the moat were places to play,
1114677	not stout defenses, and we gave no thought to the necessities that must have required their construction.<br><br> We used to reach the sheltered orchards on the
1114678	lee side of the parapet walls, where the southern river cut through the city, by swimming across the water.<br><br> The rich folk who lived in the great manses
1114679	there would shout from their windows and shake their fists, for we would run through their gardens and tear up the delicate foxgloves and orfleurs with our unshod dirty feet. Then we would dive
1114680	into the water and splash merrily to the fruit trees.<br><br> The southern river lazily slid under an ungated arch in the mighty wall, and we would lay on the
1114681	grassy bank and watch it gurgle by the lily pads.<br><br> That spring that pleasant spot became the doorway through which our city of Trinsic let in the monstrous deformed
1114682	humanoids that savaged us. I lay upon that grassy bank and watched them wade in, their coarse hair wet and matted, algae and muck festooning their wild brows.
1114683	They caught sight of a quicksilver girl with bright blond hair and lively eyes. Her name was Leyla and that spring I had held fond dreams of holding her hand and sharing flavored ice while dangling
1114684	our feet off the small bridge by Smugglers Gate.<br><br> And I said nothing when they caught her, and did not cry out when they dragged her off through that breach in our wall,
1114685	and did not warn the city when I saw the helmeted orc captains call the charge upon the mansions.<br><br> Blame me not, for I was but a child, and one who hid in the branches of
1114686	the peach trees, all a-tremble whilst I watched the smoke rise from Sean the tailor's, and fire lash out at the roof of witchy Eleanor's tavern.<br><br> To this day I have had
1114687	no word of Leyla, and to this day the smell of burning wood can conjure terrible dreams. Yet with the eyes of adulthood, 'tis possible to examine the flaws in the defense of Trinsic on that fateful
1114688	day, and the reasons why our walls are now double-thick, and why our buildings are now built as fortresses within a somber fortified city.<br><br> While I can look out
1114689	from the top of the new Knight tower, and spy the mighty white sails across the barrier island, and can descry the small hollow south of the city where gypsies are wont to camp, I can also
1114690	envision the city as it might be burning, and I bless the bargain we made: space for safety, grace for sturdiness and wood for stone.<br><br> Whilst I live, I shall not
1114691	see Trinsic burn, and no more cries of little girls will haunt the sleep of our fair citizens.<br><br>- Japheth Knight Guildmaster of the City of Trinsic
1114692	<br>
1114693	Her name was Leyla, she said, and her hair was braided wild with creepers and thorns. I marveled that they did not hurt her, but when I asked, she but shrugged and let her eyes roam once more
1114694	across the woods. Though I had my hands securely fastened by her ropes, I itched to reach out and comb that unruly golden mane, dirtied and leaf-ridden.
1114695	Her provenance, she told me over nights illuminated by campfires, was once the city of Trinsic. She claimed to have been kidnapped and raised by orcs, which I judged an unlikely tale, for all know
1114696	orcs delight in eating the meat of honest folk. When I told her this, she laughed a fey laugh, and gaily admitted that honest she was not, for oft had she stolen folk away from caravans to loot their
1114697	possessions from an unconscious body!<br><br> At this, I began to fear for my life, and her smile seemed full of teeth sharper than a human ought to have, for the
1114698	tale of orcish raising had struck fear into the marrow of my bones. "Wilt thou eat me?" I asked, a-tremble, fearing the answer.<br><br> And she cocked her head
1114699	at me, like a wild animal facing a word that it dost not understand, and the fixity in her eyes was a glimpse into the deeper reaches of the Abyss. But she finally grunted, and said "Nay," in
1114700	a voice that recalled to me a child. "Nay," she said, "for thou dost remind me of a boy I knew once, when I was a girl who played in a city of great sandstone walls, before I was taken. He
1114701	had sandy hair like thee, and I dreamt as a child of holding his hand and sharing flavored ice. His name was Japheth.<br><br> The next morning she let me go, stripped of
1114702	my pouch and clothes, and bade me run through the woods, and to fear recapture, for surely her heart would not soften again. 'Twas a fearful run, and I came to the road to Yew with welts
1114703	and scratches run rampant crost my skin, but I did not see her again.<br><br> Oft have I wondered of the boy named Japheth, and whether he
1114704	remembers a girl who lived in sandstone walls. The only Japheth I know is the Guildmaster of Knights who died last year warring amidst the orcs, and though he had indeed sandy hair, I
1114705	cannot picture him side by side with a feral girl whose tongue has tasted of human flesh.<br><br> Yet the paths of fate are strange indeed, and I suppose 'tis possible that
1114706	this knight died defending his remembered lady's honor, unknowingly struck down by the orc that she called father.

1114708	Clarke's Printery is Honored to Present Tales from Ages Past!<br><br> Guilhem the Scholar Shall End Each Volume with Staid Commentary.
1114709	THE RHYME<br>Dance in the Star Chamber<br>And Dance in the Pit<br>And Eat of your Entrees<br>In the Glass House you Sit
1114710	COMMENTARY:<br> A common feeding rhyme for little babies, 'tis thought that this little ditty is part of the corpus of legendary tales regarding the world before Sosaria (see the
1114711	wonderful fables of Fabio the Poor for fictionalized versions of these stories, also available from this same publisher). <br><br> According to these old tales, which survive
1114712	mostly in the hills and remote villages where Lord British is as yet a distant and mythical ruler, the gods of old (a fanciful notion!) met to discuss the progress of creating the world in
1114713	mystical rooms. A simple analysis reveals these rooms to be mere mythological generalizations.<br><br> "The Star Chamber" is clearly a reference to
1114714	the sky. "The Pit" is certainly an Underworld analogous to the Snakehills of other tales, and "the Glass House" is no doubt the vantage point from which the gods observed their creation.
1114715	All is simple when seen from this perspective, leaving only the mysterious reference to dinners. Oddly enough, the rhyme is universally used only for midnight feedings, never during the day.
1114716	<br>
1114717	<br>
1114718	The WREN is a tiny insect-eating bird with a loud voice. The cheerful trills of Wrens are extraordinarily varied and melodious.<br><br> The SWALLOW is easily
1114719	recognized by its forked tail. Swallows catch insects in flight, and have squeaky, twittering songs.<br><br> The WARBLER is an exceptional singer, whose extensive songs combine
1114720	the best qualities of Wrens and Swallows.<br><br> The NUTHATCH climbs down trees head first, searching for insects in the bark. It sings a repetitive series of notes
1114721	with a nasal tone quality.<br><br> The agile CHICKADEE has a buzzy "chick-a-dee-dee" call, from which its name is derived. Its song is a series of whistled notes.
1114722	The THRUSH is a brown bird with a spotted breast, which eats worms and snails, and has a beautiful singing voice. Thrushes use a stone as an anvil to smash the shells of snails.
1114723	The little NIGHTINGALE is also known for its beautiful song, which it sings even at night.<br><br> The STARLING is a small dark bird with a yellow bill and a squeaky,
1114724	high-pitched song. Starlings can mimic the sounds of other birds.<br><br> The SKYLARK sings a series of high-pitched melodious trills in flight.
1114725	The FINCH is a small seed-eating bird with a conical beak and a musical, warbling song.<br><br> The CROSSBILL is a kind of Finch with a strange crossed bill, which
1114726	it uses to extract seeds from pine cones.<br><br> The CANARY is a kind of Finch that I often kept as a pet. Miners would often take Canaries underground with them, to
1114727	warn them of the presence of hazardous vapors in the air.<br><br> The SPARROW weaves a nest of grass, and has an unmusical chirp for a voice.
1114728	The TOWHEE is a kind of Sparrow that continually reminds listeners to drink their tea.<br><br> The SHRIKE is a gray bird with a hooked bill.
1114729	Shrikes have the habit of impaling their prey on thorns.<br><br> The WOODPECKER has a pointed beak that is suitable for pecking at wood to get at the
1114730	insects inside.<br><br> The KINGFISHER dives for fish, which it catches with its long, pointed beak.<br><br> The TERN migrates over
1114731	great distances, from one end of Britannia to the other each year. Terns dive from the air to catch fish.<br><br> The PLOVER is a bird that distracts predators
1114732	by pretending to have a broken wing.<br><br> The LAPWING is a kind of Plover that has a long black crest.<br><br> The HAWK is a
1114733	predator that feeds on small birds, mice, squirrels, and other small animals. Small hawks are known as Kites.<br><br> The DOVE is a seed-eating bird with a
1114734	peaceful reputation. Doves have a low-pitched cooing song.<br><br> The PARROT is a brightly colored bird with a hooked bill, favored as a companion by pirates.
1114735	Parrots can be taught to imitate the human voice.<br><br> The CUCKOO is a devious bird that lays eggs in the nests of Warblers and other small birds. Cuckoos have the
1114736	uncanny ability to keep track of time, singing once at the beginning of each hour.<br><br> The ROADRUNNER is an unusual bird with a long tail, which runs swiftly
1114737	along the ground hunting for lizards and snakes.<br><br> The SWIFT is a very agile bird that spends nearly its entire life in the air. With their mouths wide open, Swifts
1114738	capture insects in mid-flight.<br><br> The HUMMINGBIRD is a cross between a Swift and a Fairy. These tiny, brightly colored birds hover magically near
1114739	flowers, and live on the nectar they provide.<br><br> The OWL is a reputedly wise bird that is active at night, unlike most birds. Owls have excellent night vision and
1114740	low-pitched hooting calls. Their wings are silent in flight.<br><br> The GOATSUCKER is a strange owl-like bird that is thought to live on the milk of goats. These
1114741	mysterious birds make jarring sounds at night, for which reason they are also called Nightjars.<br><br> The DUCK is a bird that swims more than it flies, and has a nasal
1114742	voice that is described best as a "quack".<br><br> The SWAN is a kind of long-necked Duck that is all white. Swans are usually voiceless, but they are said to have an
1114743	extraordinarily beautiful song.
1114744	This reference work is intended merely to serve as resource for those curious as to the full range of trades and societies extant in Britannia and nearby nations. For each trade
1114745	or guild, their blazon is given.

1114791	These are the basic elements to consider in assessing a weapon of which all warriors who regard themselves as more than mere mercenaries should be aware.
1114792	First and most obvious is the amount of damage that the weapon may do against unprotected flesh. While 'tis this which first attracts the attention of the novice, 'tis a deadly mistake to regard it as
1114793	the sole value of a weapon. While it may prove devastating indeed as a means of causing damage, a weapon must also serve as stout shield when engaged in combat.
1114794	Hence the second issue to which to pay attention is the amount of protection that a weapon may offer. Pay close attention to the guard on it, if it be a blade, or the stoutness of its
1114795	wood if it is a pole arm.<br><br> Oft related to this is the weight of a weapon, for a heavy weapon is more difficult to maneuver to block with, though it may do more
1114796	damage to thy opponent.<br><br> If a weapon is too heavy for the wielder to move it freely, they should choose another and not attempt to prove their prowess by the size
1114797	of their sword.<br><br> The reach of a weapon both increase its defensive ability, and renders it more useful in open spaces as it allows attack against the
1114798	opponent without the need to close. But be aware of the limitations of thy weapon! For a weapon with great reach may be useless in close quarters, for lack of space to maneuver it. Should that
1114799	dagger-wielding enemy close on thee and thy halberd, 'tis best to flee.<br><br> Lastly, a factor that must always be considered is the condition of the weapon. It might be a
1114800	wondrous magical blade of surpassing sharpness and it may leap to block blows with a mind of its own. It also might be of such flimsy construction, or damaged to such an extent, that the first
1114801	time it clangs against steel, 'twill shatter into useless shards.<br><br> Seek ye a good blacksmith should thy weapon become damaged, but be aware that their
1114802	ministrations may simply make the matter worse.<br><br> While mages of some ability oft create magical weapons which enhance skill, are preternaturally sharp, or incinerate the
1114803	enemy as they fall, to mind the greatest gift that they can grant a stout sword is to make it resistant to damage, for they own skill can make up the difference. Except for the fireball,
1114804	but if the corpse is charred, then so will be the possessions, which maketh looting difficult!
1114805	The dungeon known as Despise is in fact not a dungeon as such, but rather a large natural cave. Inhospitable and unfriendly to visitors, it is filled with damp spots where the deadly Exploding
1114806	Red Spotted Toadstool grows in abundance.<br><br> According to the oldest of historical texts, in days gone by the cave was once the home of three separate tribes who
1114807	had come to an accommodation with each other. Oddly enough, the three tribes were of dragons, lizard men, and rat men. While today few except extremists associated with Lord
1114808	Blackthorn regard these latter two as being intelligent beings, apparently they have indeed fallen from a more evolved state over the years.
1114809	'Tis said that these three races did dwell in relative harmony within the vast cave, building when they required it, and trading amongst themselves if needed.
1114810	But over time, something happened, and they were forced to withdraw from their society, until today thou mayst find individuals of each species within the dungeon, but never again as a civilization.
1114811	'Tis also said that someday the three tribes may return to Despise, to once again inhabit it together.<br><br> Until then, nothing remains as token of this
1114812	save an oddly intelligent skeleton, magically enchanted, that doth speak when questions are asked, and from whom I obtained these tales one day, when I was pursued by evil monsters and fled
1114813	into his skeletal arms.<br><br> Fortunately, I escaped and lived to write it all down!

1114848	The Orcish tongue may fall unpleasingly 'pon the ear, yet it has within it a complex grammar oft misunderstood by those who merely hear the few broken words of English our orcish brothers
1114849	manage without education.<br><br> These are the basic rules of orcish:<br><br> Orcish has five tenses: present, past, future imperfect, present
1114850	interjectional, and prehensile.<br><br> Examples: gugroflu, gugrofloog, gugrobo, gugroglu!, gugrogug.<br><br> All transitive verbs in
1114851	the prehensile tense end it "ug".<br><br> Examples: urgleighug, biggugdaghgug, curdakalmug.<br><br> All present interjectional conjugations start with
1114852	the letter G unless the contain the third declensive accent of the letter U. <br><br> Examples: ghothudunglug, but not azhbuugub.
1114853	The past tense can only refer to events since the last meal, but the prehensile tense can refer to any event within reach.<br><br> The present tense is conjugated like the future
1114854	imperfect tense, when the interrogative mode is used by pitching the sound a quarter-tone higher. Orcish hath no concept of person, as in first person, third person, I, we, etc.
1114855	Orcish grammar relies upon the three cardinal rules of accretion, prefixing, and agglutination, in addition to pitch. In the former, phonemes combine into larger words which may contain full
1114856	phrasal significance. In the second, prefixing specific phonetic sounds changes the subject of the sentence into object, interrogative, addressed individual, or dinner.
1114857	Agglutination occurs whenever four of the same letter are present in a word, in which case, any two of them may be removed or slurred.<br><br> Pitch changes the
1114858	phoneme value of individual syllables, thus completely altering what a word may mean. The classic example is "Aktgluthugrot bigglogubuu dargilgaglug lublublub" which can mean "You are such a pretty
1114859	girl," "My mother ate your primroses," or "Jellyfish nose paints alms potato," depending on pitch.<br><br> Orcish poetry often relies upon repeating the
1114860	same phrase in multiple pitches, even changing pitch midword. None of this great art is translatable.<br><br> The orcish language uses the following vowels:
1114861	ab, ad, ag, akt, at, augh, auh, azh, e, i, o, oo, u, uu. The vowel sound a is not recognized as a vowel and does not exist in their alphabet. The orcish alphabet is best learned using the classic rhyme
1114862	repeated at 23 different pitches:<br><br> Lugnog ghu blat suggaroglug, <br> Gaghbuu dakdar ab highugbo,<br> Gothnogbuim ad
1114863	gilgubbugbuilug<br> Bilgeaugh thurggulg stuiggro!<br><br>A translation of the first pitch:<br> Eat food, the first letter is ab,
1114864	Kill people, the next letter is ad,<br> I forget the rest<br> But augh is in there somewhere!<br><br> What follows is a complete phonetic library
1114865	of the orcish language: ab, ad, ag, akt, alm, at, augh, auh, azh, ba, ba, bag, bar, baz, bid, bilge, bo, bog, bog, brui, bu, buad, bug, bug, buil, buim, bum, buo, buor, buu, ca, car, clog, cro, cuk, cur,
1114866	da, dagh, dagh, dak, dar, deak, der, dil, dit, dor, dre, dri, dru, du, dud, duf, dug, dug, duh, dun, eag, eg, egg, eichel, ek, ep, ewk, faugh, fid, flu, fog, foo, foz, fruk, fu, fub, fud, fun, fup, fur, gaa,
1114867	gag, gagh, gan, gar, gh, gha, ghat, ghed, ghid, gho, ghu, gig, gil, gka, glu, glu, glug, gna, gno, gnu, gol, gom, goth, grunt, grut, gu, gub, gub, gug, gug, gugh, guk, guk,

1114869	While 'tis true that the musician who seeketh only to make sweet music for herself and for others needs little more than some talent, and stern practice at the chosen instrument, those of us
1114870	who seek the open road shall find indeed that a greater skill is required. Herein discover those secrets which I have learned over the years as an itinerant performer...
1114871	Once I was in Jhelom, and accidentally angered a bravo of some local repute, whose blade flickered all too eagerly near my slender neck (for I was young then). After various threats to "ruin
1114872	my pretty face" this bravo grabbed my arm in a most unseemly fashion and tossed me into a barbaric enclosure locally entitled a dueling pit. My plaintive cries for help went unheeded by the
1114873	guards, for the inhabitants of Jhelom are eager indeed to measure fighting prowess at any time!<br><br> What saved me was the ability to improvise a
1114874	melody and tune that satirized the proceedings, and sufficiently angered an onlooker to prod him to coming to my defense. Once that fight was underway I was able to make good my escape.
1114875	Hence, I regard the ability to incite fights as indispensable to the prudent bard.<br><br> Upon another occasion, 'twas the obverse side of that coin which saved me
1114876	for I was being held prisoner by a particularly nasty band of ruffians who had seized me unawares from the road to Vesper.<br><br> They had worked
1114877	themselves into a frenzy and were ready to attack and I fear, tear me limb from limb, when I began to sing frantically, tapping my fallen drum wit my tied up feet. The melody developed into a soothing
1114878	one, and the brigands slowly calmed down to the extent of apologizing, and they let me go!<br><br> A final example I would pray you grant your attention: once I was lost
1114879	upon a large isle far to the east of the mainland, well beyond Serpent's Hold, where lava made its sluggish way across the surface landscape. And this accursed land was filled with vile beats and
1114880	cunning dragons.<br><br> I was being pursued by one of said fell dragons when I found myself trapped. I quickly skirted a bubbling pool of molten rock and attempted to
1114881	hide.<br><br> The dragon scented me and was preparing to skirt the pool, when I began to play a lusty tune upon my lute that attracted its attention.
1114882	Mesmerized and enticed by the melody, it stepped directly towards me, and into the lava-where its foot was so burned that it quickly hopped away, undignified and annoyed.
1114883	'Tis my fond hope that other travailing minstrels shall learn from my experience and apply themselves to practicing these skills in order to preserve life and limb.

1115317	Ranger of the Abyss Part 1: A Light in the Darkness
1115318	This quest is part of a series that will determine who will win one of two housing plots in the Stygian Abyss (the other is winnable by a gargoyle character).  Obtain the following items and bring them to Dexter: a lantern, a silver sapling seed, a rare serpent egg and a dark wisp orb from Ilshenar.  When you have the items, he will give you a lamp of spirituality.<br><br><center>-----</center><br><br>So, you are one of the candidates for the position Ranger of the Abyss?  Very good, I will help you prepare.<br><br>For Dawn's campaign you will need a lamp of spirituality.  A lamp of spirituality detects extreme levels of good and evil. In this case we are using it to detect evil... and err, good.<br><br>Anyway, it doesn't detect the garden variety evil that one might normally find in Britannia or it would just be changing color all the time and not be very useful.  It detects infernal evil, as in arch-demon levels of evil. You are going to be using its power to detect the influence of the Slasher of Veils!  When you are in the Stygian Abyss, you will see that its light turns from white to purple, this is due to vice corruption.<br><br>I will make one of these lamps for you but you will need to gather the ingredients.  The ingredients are both common and rare, but I assume that you are prepared for adventure?  The ingredients are... are you writing this down?  The ingredients are:<br><br>1) a lantern<br>2) a silver sapling seed<br>3) a rare serpent egg<br>4) a dark wisp orb<br><br>I hear the rare serpent egg can be found near the lair of Medusa in the Abyss... very dangerous, better you than me... err, no offense intended.  The wisp orb is an item that is usually protected by dark wisps.  I understand that there are some in Ilshenar, if you see some wisps look around for a treasure chest, a wisp orb will be inside... it's weird, I know.  Hmm... I wonder how they open the chest?  Anyway, I'm pretty sure you are going to have to kill the wisps to break the spell on the chest.<br><br>Are you prepared to take on this dangerous quest?

1115328	Very good, it will only take a minute for me to combine these.<br>Dexter moves quickly about the lab, dipping the ingredients in strange chemicals, putting them into strange contraptions, and occasionally hitting them with a hammer.<br>"Here you go," he says with a satisfied smile.  "One bona fide lantern of spirituality.  If you ever need to refill it, you can use regular lamp oil.  Take this to Sir Geoffrey, he will tell you what to do with it.  You can find him at the guard station by the gate of the castle."

Completing this quest gives its own rewards.<br><br>Take your lamp of spirituality and the virtue crystal that Sir Geoffrey will give you into the Stygian Abyss.  Find a location where the light of the lamp turns green and bury the crystal at the spot.  Then return to Geoffrey for your reward.  A new location will be revealed each day.  If you would like to repeat the quest, you may bury a crystal at each location once.<br><br><center>-----</center><br><br>Hail citizen!  I see you have a lamp of spirituality.

You are to find a new location where your lantern turns green and bury the virtue crystal there.<br><br>Eventually, we hope you will find a location in the Abyss where your lantern is not a strange color and we believe that we will be able to build an outpost there.

1115383	This quest is part of a series that will determine who will win one of two housing plots in the Stygian Abyss (the other is winnable by a human character). Obtain the following items and bring them to the Lens Maker: a lantern, a draconic orb, cherry blossoms from the shrine of Isamu, and a flaming bud from the cyclops treasure in the Lost Lands. When you have the items, take them to the Lens Maker in the Holy City of Ter-Mur and he will give you a lamp of singularity.  You will need this item for future quests in the series.<br><br><CENTER> ----- </CENTER><br><br>What?  Oh, you're here about the lamp of singularity.  Hmm... let me see.  Wait, I don't think I have one....  No worries, I can make a new one, just give me a few...<br><br>Wait, I don't have the ingredients...<br><br>Ok, well, here's the deal.  I can make you a lamp of singularity but you will need to gather the ingredients.  They are... wait... oh, I know, they are:<br>1) a lantern<br>2) a draconic orb, found in the abyss near the lair of the Stygian Dragon.<br>3) cherry blossoms from the Shrine of Direction... err... wait, that shrine has been consumed by the void.  Oh, I've heard of a place in the human world, the shrine of Isamu... sure, I'll just have to straighten them out a bit... get some cherry blossoms from that place.<br>4) a flaming bud from the cyclops in... wait, that place was consumed by the void too... Hmm, I hear from visitors that there are cyclops in the Lost Lands of the human world, some of them may have a flaming bud as a treasure.<br><br>Ok, so if you bring me those things, I will make you a sandwich... wait, I mean I will make you a lamp of singularity.

1115400	Suit yourself.  I'm sure someone is going to want to gain the queen's favor... what with her preventing our world from being destroyed and all.<br><br>If you change your mind, come on back, I appreciate the company.<br><br>It's not like the old days... back in the old days everyone was like, "Party at the lens maker's!" Of course, that was before I lived 50 yards from the edge of the world...
1115401	Ah, you're back.  Wait... why are you back?<br><br>Let's go through it again, shall we?  You need a lantern (NOTE: make sure the lantern is turned off or he won't take it... he's just like that), a draconic orb from the abyss, cherry blossoms from the shrine of Isamu, and a flaming bud from the cyclops in the Lost lands.
1115402	Ah, you're back. Oh, I see you have some... stuff.<br><br>Oh right, you wanted me to make you a sandwich.  No, wait, don't tell me... you wanted me to make you...<br><br>Give me a small hint... starts with... oh, a lamp of singularity!  I got it!  Ok, no problem, I can do that.<br><br>Here you go!  Now, you need to go to the Royal City and speak with Uskadesh.  You can find him in his office at the Ministry of War, east of the city.
1115403	Come in, come in! Uskadesh told me you were coming.
1115404	Yes, I know.  Sir Geoffrey told me you would be coming to see me.
1115405	Only by living by the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues may we as a society bring about a return to our former glory. We must walk strong and not be set astray by those who would put the individual above the community or who mask their greed and lust for power behind a facade of open dealings. Our bravery, our passion, and our pursuit of truth will deliver us from chaos!
1115406	Clear vision and accountability are the keys to bringing about a new age of prosperity for all Sosaria. Prosperity does not reward those who pine for the glories of past ages and dead kings, nor does it brook oppression. We are an alliance of regular, hard working people who have united our resources and experience to take back Felucca from those who would place their zealotry or vanity above our freedom.  Beware, ye would be oppressors, the Free Tradesmen protect their own.
1115407	The right to rule is earned by conquest, not by paying lip service to an archaic system of virtues or by paying bribes. There is little hope in praying for the return of a long-departed king and yearning for the return of a golden age long past. Power lies not with the common man but with the warlords who will rise up and seize it. These are the truths the Guardian teaches.

1115451	Hark! You have discovered a location where the corruption of the Slasher of Veils is very low!  Your quest is complete, go and tell Sir Geoffrey at once! (Just take the virtue crystal back to Sir Geoffrey, you don't need to bury it now.)
1115452	You carefully bury the virtue crystal in the ground near the virtue node.
1115453	Well done.  As the corruption in the Stygian Abyss is cleaned away, we hope more virtue nodes will be uncovered that are currently overwhelmed by the presence of the Slasher of Veils.  (OOC: A new virtue node will appear each real day 'til the location is found!)<br><br>Behind me you will find my war chest.  As the kingdom has many challenges that I must address and the rewards at my disposal are varied, I ask that you take one item at random from that chest as your reward.
1115454	This is great news!  In spite of the fact that I now owe Dexter 50 gold...  Anyway, well done!<br><br>I will send a page to the queen at once and dispatch some royal architects to get started.  Please, take something from my war chest for your good work.<br><br>This campaign is not over, all we know for sure is that the corruption at that location is low enough that your lamp can't detect it.  Come see me tomorrow, as you are on the queen's short list for people to appoint as the new Ranger of the Abyss.
1115455	You carefully bury the order crystal in the ground near the order node.
1115456	You recall that Uskadesh told you to bury this crystal near an order node in the Stygian Abyss, so you don't bury it here.
1115457	order crystal
1115458	So, you have found our long sought location!  This is encouraging, indeed!  However, let's not celebrate too quickly, there will be time enough for that when we have the outpost in place.  I will have the queen informed presently of your success.  I will also send a flight of architects down to begin building.<br><br>Please, take something from my war chest as your reward and return to me tomorrow, after I have had a chance to speak with the queen.  You are well favored for your service and may yet be appointed Warden of the Abyss!
1115459	As you step into this place, you instantly feel more relaxed.  The lamp confirms your intuition, this is the place you have sought.  You must return to Uskadesh with this news at once.  (Just take the order crystal back to Uskadesh, you don't need to bury it now.)
1115460	Warden of the Abyss Part 2: Elements of Order
1115461	This quest is part of a chain that will lead to winning a special housing plot within the Stygian Abyss. You may complete this quest more than once but it is not required to win the house. Completing this quest gives its own rewards.<br><br>Take your lamp of singularity and the order crystal that Uskadesh will give you into the Stygian Abyss. Find a location where the light of the lamp turns blue and bury the crystal at the spot. Then return to Uskadesh for your reward. A new location will be revealed each day. If you would like to repeat the quest, you may bury a crystal at each location once.<br><br><center>-----</center><br><br>May the queen find favor with you!  I see you have obtained a lamp of singularity, pity they have been rare for so long... anyway, no time for regrets, we have important work for you and your lamp!  Queen Zhah has declared that we will have an outpost in the Stygian Abyss to watch for new threats to our people and by the Principles we will have one!<br><br>So far, our efforts have been unsuccessful due to the energies of the abyss being too unstable.  Anything we build there crumbles within the hour.<br><br>Naxatilor, whose wisdom has always served us well, has recommended a strategy.  There are places in Ter Mur the mystics call "order nodes."  These locations are the source of all order and stability.  They connect to each other and create a framework on which we build our magic and our society.<br><br>Naxatilor believes that these nodes also exist in the Stygian Abyss... despite its apparent utter chaos.  I want you to travel the Stygian Abyss where the chaos makes your lamp glow red.  If you find an order node, your lamp will glow blue.  Plant the order crystal that I give you there.<br><br>As the crystal grows in the energy of the node, the node will be amplified and push back the chaos, hopefully revealing other nodes and ultimately an area of stability where we can build our outpost. If you will take this quest, your service will be rewarded from my war chest.
1115462	Bury the order crystal in the specified location.
1115463	A random treasure from Uskadesh's war chest.
1115464	So be it.
1115465	I need you to go quickly, the survival of our entire race may depend on it!<br><br>Remember, take your lamp of singularity and the order crystal into the Stygian Abyss and search for order nodes.  If you find one, reinforce it with the order crystal I gave you.  Report back to me when you have succeeded.<br><br>Your people are depending on you.
1115466	So, there is hope after all.  Your success and the knowledge that Naxatilor's plan may yet succeed is very encouraging.  These times are dark and our people need a victory.<br><br>Behind me you will find my war chest.  As there have been many demands placed on it in recent years, my capacity to reward those who serve is varied and I ask that you take one item at random from that chest as your reward.<br><br>Perhaps in time the order node that you have reinforced with the crystal will strengthen more nodes in the way that your success has strengthened my resolve.  We must succeed, there is no other option.  (OOC: A new order node will appear each real day until the location is revealed.)

You will not need to take possession of the housing plot immediately, contact Mesanna at barmstrong@ea.com when you are ready to receive the house.<br><br><center>-----</center><br><br>Oh good, you're back.  Now that we have found a suitable place to build an outpost, we have one final task.  All houses in Sosaria are protected by powerful magic that keeps them secure.  This magic is infused in the ink that we use to make house deeds.  Our normal house deed ink has failed to deed the outpost so Dexter has been working on an alternate formula.<br><br>Because so many have helped get us to this point, Queen Dawn has decided to turn the selection of the Ranger of the Abyss over to fate.  To that end, I have been ordered to commission those who have helped with this campaign to test the new formulas.  Whoever tests the winning formula will be appointed the Ranger of the Abyss.<br><br>You will need your lamp of spirituality for this test, take the lamp and the ink into the Stygian Abyss and go to the location of the Outpost.  When your lamp has turned its normal color, pour the ink into the flame.  If the formula is right, the flame will dance wildly, otherwise it will probably go out.  Return to me and report your findings and you will be rewarded from my war chest.
1115507	Test the virtue-infused ink as directed.
1115508	A random treasure from Sir Geoffrey's war chest and a chance to win ownership of the Britannia outpost in the Stygian Abyss.
1115509	Very well.  Your service thus far is still much appreciated and you are welcome to come back if you change your mind.
1115510	I wish you all fortune in your quest to become the Ranger of the Abyss.<br><br>Remember, you must travel to the outpost location in the Stygian Abyss and pour the ink I gave you over the flame of your lamp of spirituality.  Then you will know if you are the chosen one.
1115511	Oh, the vexation!<br><br>Ah, well.  I shall tell Dexter and he will have a new formula for you to try tomorrow if you wish to have another go at it.  Please take a reward from my war chest for your service.<br><br>(OOC: You have one chance per day per character to win until the contest is over.)
1115512	Well!  Congratulations!  It seems the fates have smiled on you today.<br><br>Take this writ that will entitle you to the appointment to the outpost and the ownership of that property.  Also, for old times' sake, help yourself a reward from my war chest.<br><br>Good luck to you in the Abyss, I can't say I envy you for moving to such a dangerous place.  Dexter will use the formula that you have proven to create a deed for you within a couple of days.  He, or one of his fellow mages, will contact you at that time.

A new problem has come upon us but we must be strong.  All houses in Ter-Mur are protected by powerful magic that keeps them secure.  This magic is in the ingredients of the ink which is used to deed the house.  The problem is, our ink is not working in the Stygian Abyss, even where the lamp of singularity does not detect chaos.<br><br>Now for the good news.  You have a very small chance to become the Warden of the Abyss.  Naxatilor is trying to create an ink formula that will work in the Stygian Abyss.  I have in my possession a vial of one of his new formulas.  I offer you the chance to take it to the outpost site and test it.  The queen has declared that whoever tests the formula that secures the outpost will be appointed Warden of the Abyss.<br><br>Test the ink by pouring the vial into the flame of your lamp of singularity while standing in the spot where we are building an outpost.  If this is the formula that works, you will know it immediately as the flame will sparkle and pop.  If the formula fails, it will probably douse the lamp.  Either way, you have done another service to your people and I will reward it from my war chest.
1115519	Test the order-infused ink as directed.

1115522	May the fates smile on you, citizen.<br><br>Remember, to test the ink you must take your lamp of singularity and the order-infused ink to the location of our outpost in the Stygian Abyss and pour the ink over the flame of your lamp.
1115523	Hmm... this is most unfortunate.  I will be relieved when this matter is put to rest.<br><br>But so be it, we shall persist.  I will tell Naxatilor that we need a new formula.

1115527	Finally, it is done!  The finger of fate has pointed at you, citizen.  You are the Warden of the Abyss.<br><br>Take this writ of the queen's declaration, it will entitle you to the property when you are ready to move.  Naxatilor will be glad that his formula has succeeded.  I will have him create a deed with it and you will have the deed within a few days.  Naxatilor or one of his assistants will contact you.<br><br>Please, take a bag from my war chest as a token of my appreciation.

1115854	We use the bane dragons because they are powerful and loyal mounts, our bane dragons cannot be stolen.
1115855	A hell hound trained by our hound masters bond to them supernaturally, the hound will defend its master to the death.
1115856	Lieutenant John of the Bane Chosen army.
1115857	It is my duty to recruit new soldiers for the Bane Chosen cause.
1115858	We seek to take back the land of Sosaria from the uncivilized races, such as the Ophidians.
1115859	The Ophidians are a vile race. I lost several members of my family when they attacked Britannia.
1115860	If you commit to our cause and help us drive out the Ophidians, I will pay you and the other soldiers from this chest.
1115861	The bounty collector is collecting crystalline blackrock to keep it from the Ophidians but he will only discuss it with those who have proven their loyalty.
1115862	If you want to prove yourself, go up to the front lines where the banners are and start killing Ophidians.  Telling me you're loyal proves nothing.
1115863	My name is-s-s Ophidian Delphi.
1115864	I s-s-seek to reward those who help us-s-s.
1115865	The Bane Chos-s-sen attack us-s-s.  They s-seek our crys-s-stalline blackrock.
1115866	The Ophidians-s-s want peace with the humans-s-s.  They attack us-s-s unprovoked... again.
1115867	This-s-s ches-s-st.  It contains-s-s s-s-some of our mos-s-st valuable treas-s-sure.  If you help us-s-s drive away the Bane Chos-s-sen, we will pay you from it.
1115868	Our alchemis-s-st trade for crys-s-stalline blackrock.  But they will not trade with those who s-s-seek to hurt us-s-s.
1115869	Thos-s-se who are loyal to us-s-s would drive away the Bane Chos-s-sen.  Help us-s-s on the front lines-s-s of the battle and you will be rewarded well.
1115870	The fear potion caus-ses-s thos-se who are affected to be paralyz-s-zed with fear.
1115871	The s-s-shattering potion caus-s-ses-s-s crys-s-stal and glass-s-s to shatter!  We have found a way to make it much more powerful than it was-s-s.  Use it against the Bane Chos-s-sen!

1150317	There seems to be unrest spreading among the refugees surrounding the Royal city. There are rumors of gargoyles willingly leaving their encampments and disappearing into the abyss. Through our own investigations, we have learned that there are militant gargoyle camps in the abyss where their magically gifted members are tapping into a new source of magic. We suspect they are tapping the void energies and require you to obtain proof so that we can prepare a plan of action to deal with any threat they may pose. Bring back all of the following

At the time a stall becomes available, the highest bid for that specific stall, or the highest bid for the first available stall (whichever is higher) wins the lease for that stall immediately. The funds for the winning bid are taken up front and there are no refunds.<br><br>Bazaar stall lease winners will be notified immediately if logged in, or at next login.<br><br>Each person may have one active bid (per account, not per character) at a time. Anyone may place, retract, or adjust a bid for a stall lease at any time. Funds for bids are held in reserve. Bids may only be funded from checks and gold in the character's bank box, and all returned bids are delivered to the claimant's bank box.<br><br>If a person is currently leasing a bazaar stall, that person may bid on another stall. If that person wins a new stall lease, the current lease is abandoned with no refund and the contents of the old stall are relocated to the new one. The current high bid on the abandoned stall immediately wins, beginning a new 7-day lease.<br><br>Anyone leasing a stall may place a hidden "match bid" to retain that stall. At the time of lease expiration, if the current highest bid for that stall is equal to or less than the match bid, the match bid wins the auction at the highest bid price and the current lease is extended for another 7 days.<br><br>The current renter may abandon a stall lease at any time but will not receive a refund.<br><br>Auction end times are always reported as approximations, and an auction reported as "Up To 6 Hours" may end at any moment.

If you are not leasing a stall, you may still adjust your Bid Match, and it will become effective when you next lease a stall.<br><br>Match Bids are rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1,000gp.

When you lower your Bid Match, excess reserved funds are returned to your bank box. When you increase your Bid Match, additional funds are reserved from your bank box. To cancel your Bid Match, enter 0 for the amount to reserve.<br><br>When your lease ends, there is an auction to determine the next tenant. If your Bid Match is exceeded, the stall will be leased to the winning bidder, and your stall's contents will be placed safely in storage for you to recover within 7 days. In this case, your Bid Match will remain reserved and may be reclaimed.<br><br>If your bid match is equal to or higher than the highest bid for your stall, then you will retain the stall lease for 7 more days, but the amount of the highest bid will be deducted from your Match Bid. In this case, the remainder continues towards your next Match Bid, and you may cancel or adjust that new Match Bid at the bazaar.

1150563	There are currently no bids to lease this stall.
1150564	You are not currently leasing a stall.
1150565	You are currently leasing a stall. If you win a bid for a new stall lease before your current lease ends, you will abandon your current stall and the contents of your current stall will be relocated to the new one.
1150566	INSTRUCTIONS
1150567	You may only have one bid, and you may not bid on the same stall that you are currently leasing. You may bid on a specific stall, or on the first available stall. If you are currently leasing a stall and you bid on another stall, winning that bid transfers your current stall's contents to the new location. This starts a new lease on the new stall and abandons your lease on your old stall.<br><br>In order to bid on a specific stall you must use the sign for that stall.<br><br>On the Stall Leasing page, enter the amount you wish to bid, and click either the "BID ON THIS STALL" or "BID ON FIRST AVAILABLE" button. (If you are already leasing that stall, the "BID ON THIS STALL" option will not be enabled.)<br><br>If you do not already have a bid, you will be creating a new bid. If you already have a bid, then you will be adjusting your bid amount and/or transferring your bid to a different stall. Funds to back your bid are transferred from your bank box immediately. The bid will fail if your bank box does not have the necessary funds available.<br><br>If you enter 0 for your bid amount, you will be canceling your bid.  If you cancel a bid or reduce your bid, a refund for the difference will be transferred directly to your bank box. This option will fail if your bank box cannot hold the new funds.<br><br>All bid amounts are automatically reduced to the next lowest multiple of 1,000gp. For example, if you enter a bid amount of 1,999gp your bid will be reduced to 1,000gp.<br><br>At the time of the auction, ties for top bid are broken in this order:<br> 1. Bids for specific stalls win over bids for first available stalls<br> 2. Bids placed earlier win over bids placed later<br><br>Note: adjusting a bid sends it back to the end of the queue for tie-breaking consideration.<br><br>Note: the person currently leasing a stall may have set a hidden "match bid" to retain the stall lease. If you do not bid over this match bid, then the current tenant retains the stall but must pay the amount of the top bid.

1150614	Your Pet Broker charges a weekly fee of 5% of the total sales price of all pets in its inventory. Fees are effective immediately upon placing pets up for sale. Fees are recalculated immediately when pet prices are changed. Once a pet is sold or removed from inventory, no more fees are charged for that pet. For example, if a pet is priced at 10,000gp, the weekly fee is 500gp. If the pet is sold 24 hours after being placed up for sale, the total fee paid for that pet will be 71gp. Fees are charged incrementally over time.<br><br>In addition, the Pet Broker charges a 5% commission on each sale. This commission is in addition to the weekly fee.<br><br>It is possible for your account balance with your Pet Broker to become negative due to fees charged. To prevent this, you must deposit sufficient funds in advance to cover fees. If your pet broker does not have sufficient funds to cover fees charged, you will be required to pay the back fees before you may alter pet pricing or adjust the shop inventory.
1150615	This broker's account balance is negative, because its weekly fees have not been paid and sales have not been sufficient to cover those fees. Before you may continue, you MUST deposit funds to cover these fees.

1150636	Commodity Broker
1150637	<CENTER>COMMODITY BROKER</CENTER><BR><BR>Commodity brokers will buy and/or sell commodity items for you. The broker charges a 5% commission on all transactions. Additionally, the broker charges a 5% weekly fee on the total sale price of all its sellable inventory. The weekly fees are charged incrementally over time. The broker charges no fees for outstanding offers to buy commodities.<BR><BR>Your commodity broker has an account balance, which you must fund from your bank box. These funds will be used to pay weekly fees on inventory for sale, and will be used to buy commodities from others. If the broker has no funds available, it cannot purchase commodities for you. Proceeds from each transaction go into this account. You may deposit into it and withdraw from it at any time.<BR><BR>To enter an item into your broker's inventory, you must have a sample of it, either as an item or a filled commodity deed. Click "Add to Inventory" and target the item or deed. It will be stored in the broker (and can be retrieved later if desired). Once your broker has stored an item for the first time, it has learned about that item and will be able to buy and/or sell that item for you.<BR><BR>After you have stocked your broker with funds and commodities, you may then set prices and trade limits. Trade limits instruct your broker to only buy a commodity when its stock level is below the limit you set, or to only sell a commodity when its stock level is above the limit you set. Your broker may buy and sell the same commodity at the same time, so long as its sale price is higher than its buy price.<BR><BR>When your broker buys commodities, the seller receives the full price you offer from your broker's account balance, and then the broker deducts its 5% commission on top. When your broker sells commodities, the broker receives the full price from the buyer, then deducts its 5% commission and adds the remainder to the account balance. Brokers cannot buy commodities when they do not have sufficient funds for the trade (i.e. 105% of the value of the trade).<BR><BR>It is possible for your broker's account balance to become negative due to fees charged. If this happens, the broker will continue to sell commodities, and any proceeds will cover the negative account balance first. However, a broker with a negative account balance will not be able to buy commodities, nor will it allow you access to its inventory, until you have deposited funds to cover the negative account balance.

Leave this value empty if you do not wish to change it.<BR>BUY LIMIT - the broker will not buy this item if it has this many or more of the item in stock. Enter 0 if you do not wish to set a limit. Leave this value empty if you do not wish to change it.<BR><BR>You may both buy and sell a commodity at the same time. In order to do so, your Sell Price must be higher than your Buy Price.<BR><BR>Your broker charges a fee of 5% of the total sales price of all sellable commodities in stock, per week. This fee is charged continuously in small increments, and is adjusted as stock levels change. There is no fee charged for buy orders.<BR><BR>If your broker's account balance becomes negative, you will be unable to access your inventory or perform any other maintenance until you deposit sufficient funds to bring the balance positive again.

1150943	not regret the choices I have made, nor do I regret accepting the responsibility bestowed upon me.  I have decided to chronicle the events of my life that led up to my ascension to
1150944	the throne.  Let history judge me as it will, but let it be by my own words.
1150945	Entry I - The Beginning
1150946	A thousand years ago, Gargish life was vastly different than the enlightened society we are today.  Controlled by an ancient system of tradition and caste, our lives were
1150947	dictated based on customs established since time remembered.  As a female, I was considered lesser than a male. In Gargish society, males were deemed
1150948	superior
1150949	Wingless Ones.  As a Broodmother, you had only one purpose:  to create children.  The creation of children was accomplished by channeling your very life force and weaving
1150950	it, manifesting it into eggs. In one birthing rite, a single Broodmother could produce anywhere from ten to twenty five Wingless Ones.  Usually, all children created were to be
1150951	male (you can designate the gender during your weaving)
1150952	The birthing ritual was conducted and overseen by the High Broodmother
1150953	This duty was sacred but it was also finite
1150954	At this point, she steps down as High Broodmother.  After five hundred years, my predecessor, Shilaxrinar could no longer perform and named me her successor.
1150955	Though all the other Mothers were envious, I was not happy to obtain this respected position
1150956	Ever since I could remember, I had chafed at the fact that females were treated as nothing but glorified slaves.  Forced to birth until our magical power was destroyed or to
1150957	be nursemaids, I vehemently disagreed with these traditions and longed to bring about change.  With my ascension to High Broodmother, I had hoped to use the
1150958	respect of the title to gain the ear of the king and perhaps bring about the change I so desperately wanted…but I was a fool.
1150959	Entry II - The Hubris of Kings
1150960	The paragon of Gargish tradition, our King had absolutely no desire to hear my thoughts and desires.  He told me that, if the Void was finally destroyed, perhaps then we could discuss
1150961	breaking tradition and granting more freedom to the females of our race. When I countered that perhaps allowing only males to fight the Void was the reason we had yet to
1150962	win, he flew into a furious rage and reminded me to remember my place.  I asked him how could I possibly forget my place when it was so small in the world and I was naught but
1150963	a glorified slave and prisoner? The King silenced me with a wave of his hand and advised me to go back to the Breeding Grounds, never troubling him with my ‘foolish notions’
1150964	again.  Bitter, I did as he asked, and bided my time until a new King was chosen.  Gargish rulers did not last long, you see. It was believed that the king must be the strongest of all
1150965	warriors, able to best any opposition. Thus, to ensure that we were consistently ruled by the best of the best, each year the Challenge Rite was conducted. During this rite, any
1150966	male who wished to challenge the current king was allowed to do so through an official session of trials by combat. Through these trials, if the current king was defeated, the
1150967	new champion of the people would ascend to the throne. It was a brutal selection process, and provided constant changes to the throne of Ter Mur. With this knowledge, I bided
1150968	my time, anxiously awaiting the next king’s selection.
1150969	Entry III - The Beginning of the End
1150970	One hundred years and countless kings later, nothing had changed. Each time a new King ascended through the Challenge, I attempted to win him over to my cause and
1150971	listen to my desires to allow my sisters and I more freedom, to aid in the battle against the Void.  Each request was refused adamantly and vehemently, the response being that
1150972	our entire society was based on these traditions and females have no purpose in life other than to heal and make children. . No matter how hard I tried, I was a female
1150973	and, in the eyes of the males, lesser than they.  I bitterly resigned myself to my fate and admitted that I would never be granted the life that I wanted. I over saw countless birthing
1150974	rites, watching my power flow out of me again and again, cursing it each time. Outside of our walls, the Void continued to swallow our land, tearing it apart at the seams.
1150975	RECYCLE ME!!!
1150976	Entry IV - The Fall of the Old Regime
1150977	The Void had always been a formidable enemy. Shapeless, unpredictable and primal, its attacks held no tactics or system.  But, that year, everything changed. For the first
1150978	time, the Void was organized. Out of the darkness, a daemon general like no other arose, rallying the seemingly mindless, destructive beasts that plagued our land into a single and
1150979	brutal force. In just a few short months, more of our kingdom had been taken by the Void than ever before, and Scelestus the Defiler had proven to be impossible to destroy.
1150980	Unlike the other creatures of the Void, Scelestus was immune to all magical and physical attacks used against him. No matter what they tried, our warriors could not manage to
1150981	harm the monster, and that was if they were even able to get close to him. Scelestus controlled a seemingly endless army of his own personal minions
1150982	monsters whose breath was lethal poison.  Desperate, our king went against the advise of his councilors and rode out in battle amidst his personal guard. Honed and war-
1150983	forged, the King’s guards were the fiercest warriors in the kingdom.  Leading the army himself, the King met Scelestus on the battlefield, determined to annihilate the beast.
1150984	It was in that moment the history of Ter Mur was completely rewritten.Trajalem, the current king, was defeated in battle by the Defiler, along with all of his guards.  The Defiler felled
1150985	them as if they were Wingless Ones, slaughtering them mercilessly. Thus, Ter Mur was without a leader.  The Royal City fell into political chaos and infighting as the councilors all
1150986	fought over who should ascend to the throne and lead the people. It was then that Naxatilor the Seer, who had been the previous king’s closest advisor, came to me and told me of
1150987	his plan, which would change my life forever.
1150988	The Seer is the one who brought the news of the king’s death to me, and of the Defiler.  As my Broodmothers and I listened, terror in our hearts, he explained how the Defiler had
1150989	proven invincible and that he feared, if something was not done, Ter Mur would fall to the void.  Naxatilor then proceeded to explain that he had been studying the Void for
1150990	generations, and testing out different theories as to how it could be attacked and, one day, defeated.  He had come to the conclusion that the key to overpowering
1150991	the darkness was in wielding its anathema against it: creation. The Void is the personification of destruction and annihilation
1150992	as its polar opposite, may prove to be an extremely potent .  Creation magic…the very magic that we Broodmothers used to create eggs.  The Seer had come to us because he wanted to
1150993	train us to wield that magic as a weapon….and fight against the Void.   The mothers were hesitant to accept as quickly as I, with the exception of one…my daughter, Rhista.
1150994	Shortly after I had given up petitioning the various kings, I found solace in creating a child of my very own, outside of the birthing rite. As High Broodmother, I was allowed to make
1150995	an exception and create a child of my own, on the auspice of naming my successor.  I had woven Rhista in a private ritual, with her being the only child I created. She
1150996	had grown into a beautiful and honorable gargoyle woman, and reminded me so much of myself.  It was she that raised her voice to the other Broodmothers in
1150997	unison with mine, inspiring them to accept Naxatilor’s offer of training on behalf of our people.Thus, our training began.
1150998	Entry V - From Broodmother to Warrior
1150999	Naxatilor put us through the most intense and demanding training that any of us had ever experienced. He ran us into the ground, a relentless and unforgiving
1151000	trainer.  But we did not complain
1151001	City and informed us that there was no more time.  Thus, for the first time in our life, we stepped foot off of Athenaeum Isle. Opening a portal, Naxatilor transported us to the Throne
1151002	Room in the Royal City. There was no time to stand in awe at the beauty we had so longed to see, as the Seer led us to the Armory, where he advised us to don any armor that would fit
1151003	us in preparation of battle. The ten of us donned haphazard, mismatching armor, and chose weapons for close combat.  I remember, in that last moment before we left, Naxatilor
1151004	turned and looked over our motley crew, nodding his head in approval. He then proceeded to explain his plan for battling the Defiler. He was confident that our magic would be
1151005	potent against the minor demons in the army, but he was unsure about the Defiler himself. He believed that the Defiler protected his body with a tightly woven shield of
1151006	corruption and Void energy, and breaking that shield may not be possible.  Thus, he offered his ultimate plan:  if we found that we were unable to wound the Void general, we were to
1151007	combine our powers and encase him in the same protective field that we used to protect newly created eggs.  When an egg is manifested, it is fragile
1151008	to weave a protective barrier around it that is full of nurturing energy. It fosters health and strength, nurturing the egg until it is ready to hatch. Naxatilor explained that we
1151009	simply must alter our intent when we weave the barrier, turning the field into a prison rather than a nurturing shield. He believed that, with our powers combined, we could
1151010	indefinitely imprison the beast, removing him from battle. It would not be a permanent solution, but something that would buy us more time to hone our powers and prepare
1151011	ourselves to face him again eventually. The next few hours were a blur. The Defiler’s army had breached the gates to the Royal City and had begun wreaking havoc in destruction in their
1151012	and uncorrupted, for countless millennia. Though I had never walked its streets, I knew what it symbolized.  That rage fueled my powers, and the daemons fell before
1151013	me. My sisters and I were like a force of nature, cutting through the daemonic forces like a furious storm. Naxatilor had been correct
1151014	fueling our magic, we were lethal to the Void. I remember fighting alongside the males of our army, and watching the respect and awe on their faces as my sisters and I slew
1151015	these vicious beasts almost instantly.  But, despite the fact that we knew our powers were lethal to the Void, it still seemed to easy. Though the army had breached the Royal City, it was
1151016	small in number. It was then that the news came which confirmed my suspicions.  The attack on the Royal City had been a distraction tactic. The Defiler had launched
1151017	an assault on the Athenaeum Isle, and it was now swarming with the bulk of his army.
1151018	Entry VI - The Cost of Victory
1151019	Naxatilor cursed and immediately opened a portal to take us back to the Isle.  As we stepped through and returned to the Isle, we all let out a cry of horror. I remember falling to
1151020	my knees, tears welling up in my eyes.Fire raged across the complex, and the daemons swarmed the area.  The Breeding Hall looked as if it were the first to have been
1151021	assaulted
1151022	before they ever had a chance to live.  It was a grisly sight which, to this day, hurts me to recall. We tore through the complex with a fury unmatched, killing every daemon that
1151023	crossed our paths. Our emotion only added fuel to our power, increasing its potency. Soon, the ground was littered with the corpses of our enemies. It was then that the Defiler
1151024	finally showed himself and the final battle began. At first, we were confident, because we were able to damage him slightly. He was so used to being invulnerable that,
1151025	when my first bolt of energy hit him, he recoiled in shock when it damaged the shield that guarded his body.  We immediately began assaulting him endlessly but, despite
1151026	being able to damage his shield, we could not destroy it. We fought relentlessly and honorably, and eventually found ourselves at the northern end of the isle. His attacks were
1151027	vicious, and we were unable to get to a point where we could begin to weave the prison that Naxatilor had instructed.  Then, the moment finally came, but at a great cost.  Rhista and I had
1151028	been separated from the other mothers during the battle, so the Defiler was between us. It was a decision made in the heat of battle, confirmed with a gaze between myself and
1151029	my sisters. They managed to distract the Defiler with their attacks, and Rhista and I immediately began weaving the prison around him. He caught on too late
1151030	forming his movements became sluggish, weighed down by the magic. Raising his arm, he uttered words we did not understand…and Rhista was instantly teleported into his
1151031	grasp. Just as the spell was completing, hardening around him, he had my daughter in his hand. The tendrils of the spell started to extend towards her, writhing up his arm
1151032	and curling around her.  In horror, I watched as my daughter was bound in the prison alongside the foul daemon. She raised her eyes to me one last time, tears
1151033	running down her face. She reached out a hand to me, and said her last word to me:  “Mother.”
1151034	Entry VII - From Warrior to Queen
1151035	Thus, we returned to the Royal City, triumphant, with heavy hearts. I was in a haze.  My entire life had been turned upside down, and I had lost the only family I had ever
1151036	known. My home was destroyed. I did not know what to do or where to go. I remember as we arrived at the gates of the city, I was practically being carried by Naxatilor,
1151037	his arm around me. All of my energy had fled from my body with the end of the war.  In that moment, Naxatilor whispered in my ear that I needed to gather my strength and stand
1151038	tall. I needed to show strength, for the people were looking to me for guidance. I was confused, but I summoned what little energy I had left and stood on my own. The Seer took my
1151039	hand, and raised it with his above our heads.  The words he uttered next sealed my fate.  Calling for the crowd to quiet, Naxatilor the Seer issued a decree to all:  “Behold your savior,
1151040	and your protector. In our darkest hour, she came to our aid.  Forged in the heat of battle, I hereby declare your new liege:  Zhah, the Gargoyle Queen.”
1151041	There was shock and surprise on all of their faces but it was immediately replaced by a wave of acceptance when they cried out in unison: “All hail our liege and savior,
1151042	Queen Zhah!!”
1151043	Entry VIII - Into the Light
1151044	Thus, tradition be damned, the Gargoyle people accepted a female as their leader.  I ascended to the throne and swore to them all that I would guide them, protect
1151045	them, and push back the Void. It was agreed that the Challenge rite would be abolished
1151046	I led my people out of the dark and into a bright future. I declared that males and females would be treated equally
1151047	had survived the Isle’s attack, I taught the power of creation magic to males of the race. In return, females were free to choose their own path, no longer bound by the limited
1151048	and narrow traditions that had led to our almost complete annihilation.The Royal City was rebuilt, stronger and more beautiful, and a period of peace existed for numerous
1151049	years. A powerful blow had been dealt to the Void, and it took time for it to recover. We remained vigilant, knowing that the day would come when it would retaliate.
1151050	When that day finally came, my people were trained in the power that would put them on equal ground against the darkness. Male and female, standing together, my people
1151051	fought together and the Void was unable to increase its hold on Ter Mur.All of this time, I have continued to sharpen and hone my powers and research ways to increase my ability.  I
1151052	have devoured every text I can find that exists on magic of all schools, hoping to find a way to destroy the Defiler once and for all when he returns to plague the land. My studies have
1151053	taken me away from the kingdom for days, sometimes weeks, at a time, but I leave my kingdom in capable hands. My people are no longer the dependent, mindless slaves that they used
1151054	to be. Freed from the social captivity our caste system had inflicted upon them, they exist in freedom and harmony. I know that, should an attack come when I am away, they will not
1151055	lack for guidance
1151056	called me paranoid
1151057	daemon, and I know, with my daughter at my side once again, I will defeat him. In the past year, I have discovered a ritual that empowers any spell that is cast during its execution.
1151058	An ancient text revealed it to me, and I have been travelling the kingdom gathering the massive amount of spell components that the ritual requires. I believe, if I am able to
1151059	conduct this ritual, a cleansing spell will purge the Defiler of his protective shield.Then, I will eradicate the daemon for once and for all. Rhista will be at my side once again, and
1151060	we will lead our people to freedom.  One day, the Void will be defeated and Ter Mur will be whole. I am the Gargoyle Queen, and this I swear to you:  we will be free of the
1151061	darkness.
1151062	To his Grace the High Scholar,<br><br>I humbly request an audience with your Grace at your earliest convenience. I wish to discuss a matter of the utmost importance.
1151063	Please send word when you have time to receive me.<br><br> - Shilaxrinar, High Broodmother
1151064	To Her Holiness, the High Broodmother Shilaxrinar:<br><br>My Lady, I am humbly honored by your request to converse. I would receive you immediately
1151065	called away by his Majesty to attend him in the Royal City. I will be gone for some time
1151066	Prugyilonus,<br><br>Forgive the lack of titles
1151067	In truth, the assistance I require may only be brought to your attention. Please send word as soon as you have returned from the city so that we may speak. It is regarding Z.
1151068	I would like you to meet with her and hopefully help dispel some of the rebelliousness I mentioned to you previously.<br><br>Shilaxrinar
1151069	By order of Queen Zhah, access to the Athenaeum Isle is strictly forbidden.<BR><BR>All bridges are to be destroyed and all portals will be closed. Only those with the Queen’s direct order and dispensation may step foot on the isle.
1151070	RECYCLE ME
1151071	What once was a center of life, learning, and beauty now sits in ruin.<br><br>Let us never forget those who lost their lives to the Defiler’s malevolent machinations.
1151072	All of our brothers and sisters, and our children that were never given their first breath, we will never forget you and your memory will live on in our hearts for eternity.
1151073	Their deaths will not be in vain

The documents that you retrieved may seem unimportant upon first glance, but they are windows into our history. <br><br>In return for your assistance, please accept this book. Written in my own hand, it is a chronicle of my life. My dearly departed friend Queen Dawn requested that I write this long ago, for us to be able to know one another better. Sadly, I was not able to finish it before she was taken from this world.

1151122	Ritual: Scales of a Dream Serpent
1151123	Thank you for heeding my summons,  adventurer.  I hope that you will be willing to come to the aid of us once again. <br><br>
1151124	You do not wish to assist me? Then I shall wait for someone who does not wish to sit idly by while my people suffer. Be gone from my sight, coward.
1151125	Were you able to acquire the scales? Please do not dally, adventurer!
1151126	You have the scales? Excellent! <br><br>
1151127	Ritual: Hair of the Dryad Queen
1151128	The next component that I require belongs to a creature you will only discover on Fire Island: a Dryad Queen. <br><br>
1151129	Have you met with Queen Oakwhisper?
1151130	You have acquired a strand of Oakwhisper's hair? You have my gratitude for your continued support. Now, for the next component.
1151131	Ritual: Tears of a Soulbinder
1151132	I fear I must now send you to convene with a creature that may not prove as willing to help as the ones you have encountered previously, my friend. I require the crystallized tear of a Soulbinder, a malevolent creature that prefers to roam the desolate edges of my kingdom where the Void has consumed much of the area.<br><br>
1151133	Were you able to obtain the Soulbinder's Tear?
1151134	You continue to amaze me, my friend. I will admit I was concerned that the Soulbinder would prove to be too much of a challenge and, yet, here you are. <br><br>Are you ready to go after the next component?
1151135	For the next component, you must traverse the northern desert. On the far edge, you will find a teleporter similar to that which you took to the Athenaeum Isle.  This will take you to a barren, small, and twisted piece of land that was long ago drained by the Void. <br><br>
1151136	Ritual: Pristine Crystal Lotus
1151137	Have you solved the secret of the lotus, my friend?
1151138	Once again, you astound me with your perserverance and triumph! I cannot thank you enough. You are truly proving yourself a loyal friend.<br><br>Now, only one component remains.
1151139	Ritual: Heart of the Night Terror
1151140	The bearer of the last component will be easy to find but extremely challenging to overcome, I fear. <br><br>
1151141	You have come this far and turn away now? I am disappointed in you, adventurer, as are my people. Should you regain your sense of honor, do let me know.
1151142	Have you slain the beast and obtained its heart? Time is of the essence, friend
1151143	The Night Terror is no more? I see by the heart in your hand that you have felled the beast.  You have truly proven yourself a friend and loyal subject. On behalf of Ter Mur, I thank you for your heroism and assure you it will never be forgotten. <br><br>With this final component, I can now begin the preparations for the ritual.  Time is waning, and I plan to bring down the stasis spell personally so that we determine when the Defiler walks again and not the other way around.<br><br>I will let you know when it is time
1151144	Catch Me If You Can!
1151145	Hey, you! You can see me? <br><br>
1151146	You don’t want to play? Boo! Go away!
1151147	Ah ha! Looks like you are not very fast. Want to play again?
1151148	Boo, I don’t like to lose! But wasn’t that fun? <br><br>
1151149	Knowledge of Nature
1151150	Greetings, mortal. <br><br>
1151151	No? You will not gain my help without proving yourself.  If you will not do so, then apparently the Gargoyle Queen was a fool to choose you.
1151152	It would appear that you need to improve your knowledge of nature, mortal.
1151153	Indeed, you are knowledge of the ways of the forest and nature, mortal. You have surprised me. <br><br>
1151154	Ah, what do we have here? <br><br>
1151155	Feed Me!
1151156	You dare refuse me? You are truly an imbecile. Ah well, I guess I shall eat you, after all! Just as soon as I finish digesting my last meal, that is.
1151157	The jar is still empty, fool.  Go get my souls!
1151158	I can smell the souls, mortal. Give the jar to me! <br><br>
1151159	Color Guard
1151160	As you approach the pedestal, you notice the shimmering barrier protecting the beautiful lotus within.  As the Gargoyle Queen warned, this barrier covers the area surrounding the pedestal, preventing access to its treasure.  <br><br>Reaching out, you test the barrier with your weapon. The weapon does not penetrate but rather acts as if it is being pushed against a brick wall. You notice, however, that making contact with the barrier causes the colored tiles around you to come to life, their brilliant colors flashing in what seems to be a sequence. <br><br>You observe the tiles as they beautifully light up, one after the other. There seems to be a pattern to their flashing
1151161	You step away from the pedestal, and the barrier shines brightly, as if mocking and daring you to accept its challenge.
1151162	As you step on the tile, the barrier around the pedestal pulses brightly for a moment and all of the tiles around you go dark. It appears that you failed to appropriately match the displayed sequence. Perhaps you should try again?
1151163	As you step upon the final tile, all of the colored tiles shine brightly and a pulse of light from the pedestal temporarily blinds you. As you lower your arm from your eyes, you see that the barrier surrounding the lotus is deteriorating.  The sparkling light fades, leaving the Lotus unprotected. <br><br>

3010100	To walk and run in the world of Ultima Online, point the mouse cursor in the direction you want your character to move and hold down the right mouse button.  As the cursor gets further away from your character, you will move faster.<br><br>You can also use a built-in feature, called Pathfinding, that navigates around obstacles to reach a specific location.  Double right-click a location to Pathfind to it.
3010101	The Paperdoll is a special view of your character that allows you to wear (or remove) armor and clothing, as well as arm yourself with a weapon.  There are several ways to display your Paperdoll, including double-clicking your character, selecting the Open Paperdoll <a href="?14">menu</a> on your character, or pressing Alt-P.<br><br>Several useful buttons, each described in their own section.  Click Related Topics above to view them all.
3010102	The Help button displays a window that allows you to contact our in-game support for issues like Harassment or getting physically unstuck.  There are also links to our Support Knowledge Base, where players can ask and find answers to game play questions.
3010103	The Options button displays the window for customizing the Ultima Online interface in various ways, such as redefining Hotkeys, changing colors, and controlling sound.
3010104	When you log out, your character stays in the world for several minutes.  However, you can log out instantly if you are in a safe location, such as an inn or secure campsite.
3010105	The Journal button displays a history of everything you have said and heard in-game recently.
3010106	The Skills button shows a list of skills and your level of expertise in each.  Many of your skill levels are modified by your stats
3010107	This button displays the chat window.  The Ultima Online chat system enables you to talk to other players on your shard who are not near you in-game.
3010108	This button toggles whether or not you are in War Mode.  In War Mode, the button is colored red and enables you to attack your opponents by double-clicking them.
3010109	This button displays your character's status bar.  The status bar shows several vital statistics for your character in either numerical or abbreviated format.
3010110	To wear a piece of armor or arm yourself with a weapon, left-click and drag the weapon or armor onto your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> character and release it.  Be warned that if you are already wearing or wielding a similar piece of equipment, you must remove that piece before you can equip the new armor, weapon or clothing.<br><br>To remove a piece of armor or disarm a weapon, left-click and drag it from your Paperdoll character into your backpack, bank box, or onto the ground.  Remember that other players can take any items you drop onto the ground!
3010111	Your character will use many different items in their travels, most of which you'll carry in your backpack.  To open your backpack, double-click the backpack picture on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a>, click the Inventory button on the toolbar, or press Alt-I.<br><br>You can move things into your backpack by left-clicking the item, dragging it over your backpack and releasing it.  Alternatively, you can drag and drop objects directly onto your character in the game and they will be automatically placed in your backpack.  Your backpack has a hard limit on the number of items it can hold, but weight is limited by your character's <a href="?21">Strength</a> statistic.
3010112	The Radar Map displays an expanded view of the surrounding terrain and architecture.  To display the Radar Map, click the Map button on the toolbar, or press Alt-R.  The Radar Map has two sizes, toggled by double-clicking the Radar Map itself, or pressing Alt-R again.
3010113	Interactive Menus are dynamic menus available on certain objects in the world, such as <a href="?31">NPCs</a>, that list the possible interactions you can have with that object.  To view the Interactive Menu for an object, left-click the object.  If you have altered the default options, you may have to use shift left-click.  When a menu selection is gray, it is not currently available, but selecting it will tell you the reason it is disabled.
3010114	To speak to other players or <a href="?31">NPCs</a>, type what you wish to say (your text will appear at the bottom of the screen as you type) and press Enter.  The text will be displayed above your head and can be seen by everyone on screen.
3010115	Players who are new to Ultima Online have an opportunity to play the game as a young character for a length of time.  Young characters are afforded certain benefits that allow them to learn the game more easily, listed in the <a href="?18">Young Player Benefits</a> section.
3010116	For your character to receive <a href="?16">Young Status</a> and benefits thereof, your account must have less than forty hours of combined playtime.  Additionally, a character automatically loses their <a href="?16">Young Status</a> if their skill point total exceeds 450 points.
3010117	Aggressive monsters do not automatically attack you.<br><br>Vendors will buy back most items that you purchased for their full value.<br><br>You are offered special quests if you selected one of the templates during character creation.<br><br>Other players cannot attack or steal from you.<br><br>Poisoned weapons do not poison you.<br><br>You can use level zero treasure maps.<br><br>Other players cannot loot the corpses of monsters you have slain.<br><br>When you die, you are teleported to the nearest healer, and retain all your possessions.
3010118	You cannot poison others with poisoned weapons.<br><br>You cannot join a faction.
3010119	Your stats are the physical and mental attributes of your character, each of which affects other sub-characteristics of your character.  Stats increase automatically based on the skills you use, up to a maximum of 100 in any single stat, and no more than 225 in total stat points.  If you have reached the 225 stat maximum, and one of your stats increases, one of the other two stats is randomly lowered to make room.
3010120	Strength is the physical essence of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are determined by your Strength.<br><br>Your maximum carry capacity in stones is calculated by: (Strength * 7) / 2) + 40.<br><br>You receive a melee percentage damage bonus of: Strength / 5.
3010121	Hit Points are a numerical measure of your ability to survive damage.  The more Hit Points you have, the tougher you are.  If your Hit Points ever go below zero, you will die.<br><br>Your Hit Points are calculated by: (Strength / 2) + 50.  Magical bonuses to your Strength add directly to your Hit Points at a ratio of 1 to 1.
3010122	Intelligence is the mental capacity of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is determined by your Intelligence.<br><br>Your Intelligence affects the rate at which your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is regained.
3010123	Your Mana is the energy that allows you to cast <a href="?35">Magic</a>.  After expending Mana to cast a spell, it slowly recovers at a rate described in the Meditation skill section.  Your maximum Mana is the same as your <a href="?23">Intelligence</a> statistic.
3010124	Dexterity is your hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes.<br><br><a href="?26">Stamina</a> is determined by your Dexterity.
3010125	Your Stamina determines how fast you can swing a weapon.  The more Stamina you have, the faster you'll swing.  Your maximum Stamina is the same as your <a href="?25">Dexterity</a> statistic.  Several factors reduce your Stamina, including: taking damage, running, and special punching moves.<br><br>When you are in a non-consensual PVP area, pushing through players and monsters reduces your Stamina by 10, and you cannot push through unless you are at maximum Stamina.
3010126	In your travels throughout UO, you will eventually find yourself locked in combat with an enemy, be it monster or player.  Weapons, <a href="?35">Magic</a>, and allies can all be used to slay your foe, and should be, for a fight persists until someone runs away, someone dies, or all combatants voluntarily cease fighting.
3010127	To attack an enemy, you must first enter War Mode by clicking the War/Peace button on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> (it will read 'Peace', since you are currently in Peace mode).  Once clicked, the button turns red, the text changes to War, and your character enters a fighting stance.  Double-clicking an enemy while in War Mode initiates an attack and places you in combat with them.<br><br>To leave War Mode, click the War button or press Tab.  Leaving War Mode ceases your attack.  Be careful, for it is unlikely your opponent will stop attacking you.<br><br>When you are first attacked, even while not in War Mode, you will automatically defend yourself.
3010128	When you take damage from weapon or <a href="?35">Magic</a>, your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are lowered.  You can raise them through being healed, unless they go below zero, in which case you will die.  You are considered to be in full health when your Hit Points are at their maximum, and you should try to maintain this state whenever possible.<br><br>You can heal with bandages by double-clicking a bandage (or stack of bandages) and targeting yourself.  This method is best suited for warriors, as it uses the Healing and Anatomy skills to determine your success.  Applying a bandage takes several seconds, and each time you take damage during that time reduces your effectiveness, so take care to run away from combat until the bandaging is complete.<br><br>Those skilled in Magery will most likely find the healing spells In Mani and In Vas Mani much more to their liking.<br><br>Those inclined in the way of the Knight, may also use their <a href="?100">Close Wounds</a> ability to heal themselves.<br><br>Should you find yourself wounded and completely without skill in the healing arts, another player can heal you at least as well as, and often better than, they could heal themselves...if asked politely. If you are <a href="?16">Young</a>, a wandering <a href="?31">NPC</a> healer will cast spells to heal you when you approach.
3010129	When an enemy is slain, not just anyone can loot treasure from the corpse.  The right to loot is determined by the amount of damage done, with substantial weight added for those who struck the initial and killing blow.  In non-consensual PVP areas, you are allowed to loot corpses without proper rights, but doing so will flag you as a criminal and is extremely likely to paint a target on your chest.
3010130	Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are living creatures controlled by the game engine.  They may react to your actions depending on the who, where, when and how of the situation.  The three main types of NPCs are: <a href="?32">Monsters</a>, <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a>, and <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.
3010131	Monsters are the ever-present inhabitants of Britannia.  Most of them are terribly aggressive, and attack on sight.  A much smaller group tries to live in peace, signified by the blue coloring of their name.  Should you decide to bring your wrath upon these peace-loving denizens, your karma will eventually be lowered until you are recognized and attacked without provocation by even them.  You can gain good standing again by slaying exclusively those monsters aggressive to everyone.
3010132	Shopkeepers buy and sell goods.  They only buy that which they sell, and their stores automatically restock several times each hour, increasing to even larger amounts when completely bought out.  To interact with a shopkeeper, left-click them to display their interactive menu, and select either Buy or Sell.  If they are near enough to their shop, an appropriate menu pops up and business commences!
3010133	A vendor is a type of player-run shopkeeper who sells only goods placed on them by their owner, at prices set by their owner.  Vendors can only be placed in their owner's house, and they do not wander.  You can browse their inventory by double-clicking them and rummaging through their backpack just as you would your own.  Single left-clicking items shows you the description of the item, as well as the price.  If you wish to purchase something, say 'vendor buy' and target the item.  You are then asked to confirm your purchase.  Remember, the money is taken directly from your bank, so you don't need to travel with large sums of gold if you go on a shopping spree.
3010134	Magic is common in the lands of Ultima Online, used by all and mastered by some.  When you try to cast a spell, your Magery skill and the spell circle determine your chance for success.  If successful, your Mana is lowered by an amount required by the spell.  High circle spells are more difficult to cast, and require a fair amount of Mana and skill in Magery before they may even be attempted.  Additionally, you must possess either a spellbook or scroll containing the spell you wish to cast.<br><br>If you use a spellbook, you must also have in your backpack the reagents required to cast the spell. See <a href="?36">Spellbooks</a> for more information.<br><br>If you use a scroll, reagents are not required, and the level of the spell is 2 circles lower for purposes of minimum Magery required and success rate.  Once successfully cast, the scroll is consumed.  Double-click a scroll to cast from it.<br><br>While casting, your hands must be free.  There is one exception, in that you may hold a spellbook in your hands if desired.
3010135	Spellbooks contain a collection of permanently inscribed spells for casting.  You may open a spellbook by double-clicking it and then flip through the pages to see which spells it contains.<br><br>If you flip to the page containing a spell, you will find a listing of the reagents required and a small representative icon.  Double-clicking the icon attempts to cast the spell.  If you drag the icon from the spellbook and drop it in the gameplay window, it behaves just as if it were in the spellbook when double-clicked, creating a handy shortcut for casting the spell.<br><br>To add a spell to your spellbook: obtain a scroll with the desired spell, and then drag and drop the scroll onto your spellbook.
3010136	Reagents are the material components used to cast a spell.  They are also used by those skilled in Alchemy to create magical potions, and are thus highly sought after in the lands of Britannia.<br><br>Reagents are purchased from <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a> in the magical and alchemical trades, and it is not uncommon to find a <a href="?34">Vendor</a> stocked with reagents as well.  They can even be picked up off the ground.  These ground-dwelling reagents tend to thrive in areas to which they are indigenous
3010137	Your bankbox is highly magical in that it is completely secure, and contains the same contents regardless of where you open it.  Your bankbox can contain no more than 125 items, but has no weight restrictions.  Stacks of items count as a single item towards the item limit.<br><br>To open your bankbox: locate a banker or minter inside a bank, left-click them to view their interactive menu and select Open Bankbox.  You can also stand next to a bank and say the word, 'Bank.'
3010138	Your skills define your character.  They are the activities in which your character most often participates and, with enough practice, excels.  Skills have a maximum trained value of 100.0, although they can go beyond that limit with rare magical items.  Additionally, you cannot exceed a total of 700 total skill points in all skills combined.
3010139	Each time you use a skill, there is a chance it will increase.  Many skills grant you a much better chance to increase if the attempt is difficult relative to its current value
3010140	Practice dummies provide a safe way to learn the basics of combat and stealing - up to 25.0 points in the respective skill.  To use a practice dummy, just move in close and double-click it.  For combat practice dummies, you'll have to wield the weapon in which you wish to train before double-clicking.
3010141	Skill Locks grant you control over your skill advancement, and are manipulated in the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>.  To open the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>, press the Skills button on your Paperdoll.  A small icon is located next to each skill.  An arrow pointing up signifies the skill can only advance.  A lock signifies the skill cannot advance or degrade.  An arrow pointing down signifies the skill cannot advance, and will eventually degrade if another skill is increased while you are at your skill total maximum.  This is very important, because if no skills are pointed down once at your skill total maximum, you cannot gain in any skill.
3010142	Fame represents how well-known you are by deeds such as completing both quests and bulk order deeds, and killing monsters worth more Fame than your current level.  If you reach a high level of Fame, your professional title becomes viewable by anyone who looks at your Paperdoll.<br><br>Each time your character dies, they lose 10% of their Fame.
3010143	Karma is a measure of both the good and evil deeds you have done, and is raised and lowered by a large and diverse number of activities.  Raising your Karma might be accomplished by killing evil NPCs, giving gold to good NPCs, or casting beneficial spells on other players.  Your Karma could be lowered by using the Snooping, Stealing, Begging, or Poisoning skill, summoning Daemons, or killing good NPCs.<br><br>Your Karma affects your title.  If your Karma ever drops to the lowest level, NPC shopkeepers will refuse to do business with you.  Player-run Vendors will continue to do business with you, however.
3010144	The chance to learn a skill is increased during the first hour of play each day for each character on your account. Note this only affects the chance to increase a skill, not the chance to succeed in using it.<br><br>You will experience a power hour during your first hour of play for each character within a 24 hour period, which means that technically, the power hour will be refreshed 23 hours after the previous power hour has ended, per character. If any character does not log in for over 24 hours, their power hour will begin as soon as they log in, and last for one full hour. Every character on your account has their own burst hour.<br><br>As an example, a player who logs in at 8:00 PM local time will experience a power hour that will last until 9:00 PM. They will not be able to experience another power hour during that 24 hour period, so they will not receive another power hour until at least 8:00 PM the following day. If they do not log in again until 10:00 PM, they will experience their full power hour, beginning at 10:00 PM and lasting until 11:00 PM. The following day, they will not be able to experience a power hour until at least 10:00 PM local time.<br><br>The times stated above are YOUR time - they are not based on any form of server time. Server time zones have nothing to do with your power hour times.<br><br>Your burst time does not carry over to another day. If you don't use your entire burst hour in any 24 hour period, you forfeit any unused time.<br><br>To benefit most from your power hour, you need to use it all at once. If you log in at 10am, play for half an hour, and log out, power hour for that character will expire at 11am. It is not saved for later.<br><br>The burst system does not affect non-difficulty skills that are below base 70.0, like Anatomy, Psychology, and Meditation. Difficulty skills are those like Tailoring, Carpentry, and Magery, where there are always more difficult levels to attain.
3010145	Public Moongates can be used to travel to various destinations throughout the land.  To use a moongate, simply step into it and choose your destination when prompted.  Once you select a destination, you will be instantly teleported there.
3010150	Plant Growing
3010151	Using special seeds harvested from slain monsters, you may grow uniquely colored plants to use as house decorations or to produce hybrid seeds and resources. <BR><BR> As your plant grows from a seed to a full-grown plant, it will need watering and alchemical care in order to protect if from insect infestations and harmful fungi.<BR><BR>Through the process of cross-pollination, you may even be the first person to grow a unique new hybrid plant type!
3010152	Plant Bowl
3010153	In order to plant a seed, you first need a special bowl.  Plant bowls can be purchased from a provisioner for a small price.<BR><BR>Once you have an empty plant bowl, you'll need to fill it with dirt before you can plant a seed in it.<BR><BR>To fill a plant bowl with dirt, double-click the bowl to use it, and then target a source of nice soft brown dirt.  If you've targeted an appropriate patch of dirt, you'll now have a bowl full of dirt.  Add in enough water to soften the dirt, and you'll have a perfect spot for planting a <a href="?50">seed</a>!
3010154	Plant Seeds
3010155	Plant seeds come in many different colors.  When planted in a <a href="?49">bowl of dirt</a> and carefully tended to over time, plant seeds will grow into full-grown plants.  These plants can be used for <a href="?70">decorative purposes</a> only, or as a source of new <a href="?66">hybrid</a> plant seeds and specially grown <a href="?69">resources</a>.<BR><BR>While you can tell what color of plant the seed will grow into by the color of the seed itself, the type of plant that results from a particular seed remains a mystery until the plant is fully-grown!<BR><BR>The first step in growing a seed into a plant is planting it in a bowl of soft dirt.  In order to plant a seed, simply double-click the seed to use it, and then target a bowl of soft dirt.  Freshly dug dirt isn't soft enough for a seed to be planted in, so you'll need to pour <a href="?61">water</a> into your bowl of dirt before attempting to place a seed in it.
3010156	Plant Growth
3010157	Plants take time to grow through their various stages.  A plant has nine main stages of growth, from <a href="?50">seed</a>, to sapling, to fully grown plant.  Plants will not grow in containers, unless the container is in a player's backpack.  If a plant is <a href="?52">healthy</a> and well-tended, it will grow one "stage" of its life-cycle in about a day's time.  If a plant is not healthy because it has not been well taken care of, then it will not grow.  You must keep your plant in a healthy state by curing it of any maladies that might be affecting it, and then letting it heal naturally or help it along through <a href="?63">alchemical means</a>.
3010158	Plant Health
3010159	Plants have hit points much like your character.  A plant loses hit points when it is affected by various maladies.  If a plant has <a href="?53">insects</a> eating at it, then it will lose hit points each day.  Other maladies that can affect a plant's health include under or over-<a href="?61">watering</a> the plant, harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>, <a href="?57">poison</a>, and <a href="?59">disease</a>.<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal potions</a> and a plant's natural healing will raise the plant's hit points back up to its maximum, but only if the plant has been cured of all maladies first.<BR><BR>If a plant loses all its hit points, it will die.<BR><BR>As a plant grows, its maximum health increases.  Seeds and saplings are very weak, and can easily be killed if neglected for even a short while.  Full-grown plants, on the other hand, could survive for several days without any help.
3010160	Infestation
3010161	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infested by insects.  These insects will slowly eat at a plant, causing it to lose <a href="?52">health</a> and eventually die.  Different plants have different chances of being infested.  Flowery plants, over-watered plants, and bright plants all have a greater chance of attracting hungry insects, so they’ll need even more attention from their owner.<BR><BR>You can use <a href="?57">poison potions</a> on your plant in order to kill off the insects that have infested it.  Be sure that you do not use too much poison, however, or your plant will soak up the poison, which can cause it to wither and die!<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?54">Infestation Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010162	Infestation Level
3010163	The Infestation Level meter (grey bug image) shows the relative amount of <a href="?53">insects</a> that are currently attacking your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small infestation.  A red + sign indicates a severe infestation.
3010164	Fungus
3010165	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infected with harmful fungi.  Fungi sap the plant of its health, which will cause it to wither and die.  It is important to remember that fungi love moist areas, so over-watering your plant increases the chance that it will become infected by harmful fungi.<BR><BR>You may cure your plant of fungus by using <a href="?59">cure potions</a>.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?56">Fungus Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010166	Fungus Level
3010167	The Fungus Level meter (mushroom image) shows the amount of <a href="?55">fungi</a> that are currently sapping health from your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small fungus infection.  A red + sign indicates a severe fungus infection.
3010168	Poison (Plants)
3010169	You may apply poison potions to your plant to kill insects infesting it.  If you apply too many poison potions, however, or apply poison potions when there are no insects on the plant, then your plant will soak up the poison and become sick.<BR><BR>When you apply poison potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as <a href="?53">insects</a> only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any insects will be killed off by your poison potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally poison your plant, you can cure the plant of poison by using <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the poison.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?58">Poison Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010170	Poison Level
3010171	The Poison Level meter (skull image) shows the amount of <a href="?57">poison</a> that your plant has soaked up.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly poisoned.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely poisoned.
3010172	Curing (Plants)
3010173	You may apply cure potions to a plant in order to cure it of harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>. If you apply too many cure potions, however, or apply cure potions when the plant is not infected by fungi, you will infect your plant with a deadly disease which will cause it to wither and die.<BR><BR>When you apply cure potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as fungi only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any harmful fungi will be cured by your cure potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally infect your plant with a disease by over-curing it, you can use <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the disease.<BR><BR>You may view your plant's current <a href="?60">Disease Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010174	Disease Level
3010175	The Disease Level meter (purple goo image) shows the strength of the <a href="?59">disease</a> affecting your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly infected.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely infected.
3010176	Watering
3010177	In order to keep your plant healthy, you must water it regularly.  An under-watered plant will wither and die if left unattended.  However, it is important to remember that over-watering your plant is also unhealthy.  Over-watered plants become waterlogged and lose <a href="?52">health</a>, in addition to becoming perfect breeding grounds for <a href="?53">insects</a> and <a href="?55">fungi</a>.<BR><BR>Each time a plant performs its <a href="?51">growth check</a> (approximately once a day), the plant will soak up one dose of water, so you'll need to keep a constant eye on your plant to make sure it has not dried out.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?62">Water Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010178	Water Level
3010179	The Water Level meter (water pitcher image) shows the amount of <a href="?61">water</a> in your plant bowl.  Unlike other state meters, the Water Level meter displays both negative (under-watered) and positive (over-watered) levels.<BR><BR>A yellow - sign indicates the plant is slightly under-watered.  A red - sign indicates a severely under-watered plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign indicates the plant has been slightly over-watered.  A red + sign indicates the plant has been severely over-watered.
3010180	Potions (Plants)
3010181	You may apply various potions to a plant in order to cure it of various maladies, help it to heal back up to maximum health, or strengthen it against infestations.  Potions are applied through the Water button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>The following potions may be used on plants :<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?59">Cure Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?57">Poison Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?65">Strength Potions</a>
3010182	Heal Potions (Plants)
3010183	You may apply heal potions to a plant in order to cure it of poison or disease.  Heal potions are applied during a plant's normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new heal potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.<BR><BR>If heal potions are applied to a plant that is not poisoned or diseased, and the plant has no other maladies currently affecting it, then the heal potions will be used to help increase the plant's current hit points (in addition to the natural healing a plant performs if it is not currently infected by any maladies).
3010184	Strength Potions (Plants)
3010185	You may apply strength potions to a plant in order to help it resist insect infestations and fungus growth.  Each strength potion applied will lower the chance of infestation by harmful maladies.  Strength potions are soaked up by a plant during its normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new strength potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.
3010186	Cross-Pollination
3010187	When a plant first reaches its full-grown state, it will sprout its full foliage, no longer contained within the plant bowl.  At this stage of the plant's growth, it will begin to produce pollen.  You can view your plant's current <a href="?67">Pollination State</a> in the Plant Resources Menu.  The plant will eventually self-pollinate if left unattended, and the plant will begin to produce <a href="?50">seeds</a>.  Seeds produced by a self-pollinated plant will grow up into an exact duplicate of the "parent" plant.<BR><BR>Another method of pollination is called "cross-pollination".  Once a plant reaches the pollen-producing stage, its pollen may be gathered by the owner by using the Cross-Pollination button.  Gathered pollen may be used on another full-grown plant.  When you pollinate one plant with pollen from another plant, the targeted plant will produce seeds that will grow into a hybrid of the two plants.  The color and type of each "parent" plant are combined to produce a new type of seed that will grow from the targeted plant.<BR><BR>While you may continue to gather pollen from a plant throughout its entire life cycle, once a plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural pollination, or through manual cross-pollination from another plant), no further combinations may be performed.  The seed type that the plant will produce is determined the first time the plant is pollinized, and cannot be changed afterwards.<BR><BR>In very rare circumstances, cross-pollination may result in a "mutation".  If mutation occurs, the targeted plant will not produce seeds that are a combination of the two "parent" plants, but will instead produce "mutated" seeds that grow into mutant plant varieties.
3010188	Pollination State
3010189	The Pollination State indicator displays the current pollination state of a plant.<BR><BR>A yellow - symbol indicates that the plant has not yet produced any pollen, as it has not reached full-grown level.<BR><BR>A red ! symbol indicates that the plant has entered its pollen producing state, and can have pollen gathered from it, or be <a href="?66">cross-pollinated</a> to.<BR><BR>A green + symbol indicates that the plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural self-pollination, or by the pollen of another plant).  While you can still gather pollen from a plant in this state, the plant can no longer be the target of cross-pollination.
3010190	Seed Production
3010191	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, it will no longer grow in size, but will instead produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> any time a <a href="?51">growth check</a> is performed.<BR><BR>The type of seed that a plant produces is determined by whether it pollinated itself, or if pollen from another plant was applied to it during the <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a> process.<BR><BR>A plant will produce one seed per day, up to a maximum of eight seeds.  A plant will only produce a seed if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather seeds from a plant by using the Gather Seeds button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available seeds from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of seeds available is displayed next to the Seed # indicator (seed image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.
3010192	Resource Production
3010193	Certain plant type and color combinations result in a plant that can produce unique resources.<BR><BR>A plant will begin producing resources at the same time it produces <a href="?50">seeds</a>, when it reaches its maximum growth level.<BR><BR>One resource is produced per day, up to a maximum of eight resources.  A plant will only produce resources if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather resources from a plant by using the Gather Resources button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available resources from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of resources available is displayed next to the Resource # indicator (petal image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.<BR><BR>Resources produced by unique plant combinations have special properties dependant on the resource type and color.
3010194	Decorative Mode
3010195	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, a Decorative Mode symbol will appear in the Resources Menu.  This symbol is displayed as a leafy plant with a red / symbol through it.<BR><BR>Pressing this button (and clicking Yes to apply) will set the plant to Decorative Mode.<BR><BR>A plant set to Decorative Mode will not produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> or <a href="?69">resources</a>, and cannot be used for <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a>.  A Decorative Plant does not need upkeep, however, and is always in a <a href="?52">healthy</a> state.<BR><BR>Decorative Mode should be activated if you simply want your plant to be used as a house decoration, and therefore do not want to have to water it or keep it healthy.<BR><BR>A Decorative Plant will have the tag [decorative] displayed above it when single-clicked.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTE : Once a plant is set to Decorative Mode, it cannot be set back to its normal state.  A Decorative Plant will never produce seeds or resources again.
3010196	Emptying the Bowl
3010197	If you would like to empty your plant bowl of the plant or seed and start over again, you may use the Empty Bowl button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>If the plant in the bowl is in the <a href="?50">seed</a> or sapling stage, emptying the bowl will result in a bowl and the seed placed in your backpack.<BR><BR>If the bowl only had dirt in it, or the plant had grown beyond the sapling phase, emptying the bowl will destroy the plant, returning only the plant bowl to your backpack.
